            RELATING TO ICFC EXPENSE SHARING
            AND MEMBERSHIP TRANSFER
            </div>
            <p>March 30, 2012</p>
            <p>The Club is aware that over the years quite a few ICFC member families have entered
            into private agreements among family members to address and govern the sharing of ICFCrelated expenses (including cottage ownership, cottage maintenance and dues) among family
            members. In some instances, family agreements also address the subjects of membership status
            and transfers of membership among family members.</p>
            <p>The Club recognizes that such agreements can be useful means of resolving uncertainty
            regarding the issues that they address. The Club believes that it is appropriate for family
            members to enter into such agreements when they desire to do so. The Club will honor
            outcomes dictated by such agreements where the outcomes are consistent with existing Club ByLaws.</p>
            <p>The Club will take no position regarding the enforceability of private family agreements.
            It will offer no advice regarding the terms of such agreements, and will have no role in the
            enforcement or interpretation of such agreements. In matters of Club affairs, the ICFC By-Laws
            as drafted take precedence over anything to the contrary in a private family agreement. (By way
            of example, it would be contrary to the By-Laws and the By-Laws would take precedence if a
            family agreement said that siblings A and B were both deemed to be corporate members, even
            though only one of them had been elected a corporate member and paid corporate dues.)</p>
