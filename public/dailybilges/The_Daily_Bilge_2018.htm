		  <p>The last meal was served in the Dining Hall for breakfast yesterday 
		  and the 138th encampment is safely over, but much excitement continues 
		  this fall.&nbsp; Below you will find a TENTATIVE timeline for the 
		  Bridge renovation subject to change based on weather and construction 
		  conditions.&nbsp; The work will be noisy and a possibly dusty 
		  operation and folks should be prepared for that!&nbsp; Do keep in mind 
		  that the Bridge site will be&nbsp;out of service and off limits&nbsp;due to its 
		  dangerous construction conditions. We don't want anyone to get in the 
		  way of the contractors or cause harm to themselves.&nbsp; If you do 
		  choose to go to camp, please enjoy the process from a safe distance. 
		  The water in camp will be on until October 1st. If there are any 
		  further updates, I will do my best to keep you informed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On 
		  another note, one of the reasons we enjoyed a great IC summer was the 
		  staff's amazing service, resilience, and personalities. Hannah Chapple 
		  captures this,&nbsp;and many other IC happenings, in her last Daily Bilge 
		  post to the ICFC website. As many members were not at the Paddle Award 
		  dinner or may have never been at camp at that time, it might be 
		  valuable to read the posting of the Daily Bilge and honor the 
		  leadership and wait staff's performance. The last installment is 
		  attached below.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why do summer days go by so fast?<br>Happy

		  <p>There is nothing like Iron City peak. Although it has died down 
		  over the past couple days, camp is still bustling with activity. Since 
		  my last Bilge we have had many tournaments, a handful of meetings, the 
		  Hootenanny, and just last night we celebrated the Paddle Award Dinner.<br>
		  <br>We have had 4 tournaments in the last two weeks, the first being 
		  the Tolley Tennis Tournament. This mixed doubles tennis championship 
		  was fought for by 18 teams, all of which played extremely well. In the 
		  finals, we watched John and Judy Sillers play against Bobby Sillers 
		  and Heather Firestone, and all players were in it to win it. 
		  Ultimately, Bobby and Heather rose up and were awarded the winning 
		  plate that night at dinner! Congratulations to them!<br><br>Friday, 
		  August 3rd was the busiest day of this encampment. All on this day, we 
		  had a Scott Barnum/Ed Bartram Sale (Thank you to Missy Hugessen), the 
		  Todd Cup, the Hootenanny, and we had over 200 people in camp! The 
		  night before, two previous winners of the Todd Cup were invited to 
		  speak in the dining hall about their technique, and it was clear both 
		  David Fritz and George Stronach IV were coming to win this year. The 
		  winning fish string was ultimately caught by David Fritz, weighing in 
		  at 9lb,14oz, and he is now one of two people who have ever won the 
		  Todd Cup 6 times (along with George Stronach the III ). The Hootenanny 
		  that night was led by Nick Steffey, Fred Crawford, and Alex Scott and 
		  we enjoyed several hours of singing camp songs, eating popcorn, 
		  watching the Salt Girls, and enjoying the company of our dear friends 
		  and family. It was a very successful evening.<br><br>While all of the 
		  peak madness was occurring, we were also in the middle of The Sillers 
		  Putting Tournament. This match play tournament was played over several 
		  days, and we had various esteemed golfers and putters sign up. In the 
		  end Jeffery Hugessen defended his title for the 5th time. The last 
		  sports related competition of the summer was The Mary S. Scott 
		  Shuffleboard Tournament. There were 19 teams signed up for the event, 
		  and we were thrilled to watch the final match after dinner on August 
		  6th . Fred Crawford and Manny Parody proved their shuffleboard skills 
		  at the end, and took home the winning title!<br><br>Although it is not 
		  sport related, last night we celebrated the coveted Paddle Award. 
		  After weeks of giving many of our staffers the title of Waiter of the 
		  Week (Jake Brown and Oliver Chapple won the last two weeks), we were 
		  very excited to give this years award to just one of our incredible 
		  waiters. Last night both our Maintenance Staff and Kitchen Staff were 
		  praised for a fantastic summer on the Georgian Bay. The grounds 
		  continue to look phenomenal thanks to Moe, Lisa, Randy, and the rest 
		  of their crew. Our new food provider Chartwells were applauded for 
		  their first successful summer &#8211; we hope they return for many more 
		  years. The Leadership Team was Rah Rah Ray&#8217;d for their hard work this 
		  summer, working as a cohesive team to make their small team of 
		  staffers successful.<br><br>The Leadership Team then took the 
		  microphone and started their speeches for our 10 amazing staffers. The 
		  speeches involved inside jokes, a poem, tearful goodbyes, and lots of 
		  goofy roasts.<br><br>After announcing all 10 of our staffers, the camp 
		  rose to sing Old Iron City and the following speech was read:<br><br>
		  &#8220;This year the Paddle Award will be given to a staffer who we can 
		  always depend on. This person is very reliable, consistent, and we are 
		  so excited to see what this staffer does in the future. They came in 
		  determined to make their summer fantastic, and we think that they 
		  succeeded greatly. When we handed out the Paddle ballots to our staff, 
		  this person received an incredible amount of love in the &#8216;comments 
		  section&#8217;. Our staff wrote things like &#8220;[They] taught us how to be 
		  successful as a staff&#8221; &#8220;[they] were always on top of it&#8221;, &#8220;good one&#8221;, 
		  &#8220;great work&#8221;, and &#8220;The only real choice&#8221;. Ladies and Gentleman, the 
		  Paddle Winner of 2018 is Bridget McCarthy&#8221;.<br><br>Congratulations to 
		  Bridget, we are so proud to announce her as our Paddle Winner. She was 
		  given a celebratory Rah Rah Ray, and immediately was carried off to 
		  the Bay.</p>
		  <p><br>That is it for this weeks Bilge! Please check in next week for 
		  the last one of the 138 th Encampment!</p>

		  As I got to know Claire, the foremost word in my mind was not &#8220;aware.&#8221; 
		  She showed up to icfc shocked to discover she would be a waiter for 
		  the summer, I watched her brew a full pot of coffee onto the kitchen 
		  floor, as she&#8217;d forgotten to put anything under the coffeemaker, and 
		  she was gracefully tricked into thinking the word &#8220;pineapple&#8221; was 
		  Canadian slang for what everyone else referred to as &#8220;spontanuity.&#8221; As 
		  I got to know Claire, however, I soon found a genuine affection 
		  growing, based in part on her virtuosic ability to have incredibly 
		  silly conversations w a perfectly straight face, her consummate 
		  knowledge of dance moves and her total lack of hesitation to call my 
		  mother a shrimp at the slightest provocation. Your guess is as good as 
		  mine as to why she thinks that&#8217;s a good insult. Nevertheless it ended 
		  up being the quiet moments on the dock talking about our families, how 
		  she&#8217;s grown to love iron city, or her fierce love for her new friends, 
		  that I realized that Claire is aware of the important things, even if 
		  she doesn&#8217;t know what to call that yellow spiky fruit.</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

		  a real person, more like a generic caricature of a surfer or lax bro. 
		  Noah could often be found wake foiling, fishing, or setting the dining 
		  hall. Few teenage boys listen to as much classic rock as Noah Mackey. 
		  With his taste in music ranging from The Grateful Dead to The Cars to 
		  Bread and his immense collection of hawaiian shirts he can most

		  Bridget McCarthy came into this summer and from the very beginning she 
		  took her newfound &#8220;elder status&#8221; with pride. Bridget was an invaluable 
		  member to our staff as her daily visits to the office kept Sanders and 
		  I sane. This summer I learned a few things about Bridget, she is an 
		  avid plate breaker, and a Childrens book Fanatic. We discovered this 
		  Childrens Book passion one night when we caught her reading Dr. Seuss 
		  to a bed full of staffers. Bridget is one of our most responsible 
		  staff members, except for when she leaves staff land to watch the 
		  sunrise, or takes what Luke says with anything less than a grain of 
		  salt. I am so happy to have Bridget as a life-long friend, and I can&#8217;t

		  Noah Petrick had never been to iron city, but he quickly became a key 
		  component of this years staff. Being a friendly and sometimes too 
		  talkative kid it was impossible to stay mad at him. His constant 
		  laughter and contagious smile was quick to lighten the mode. Petrick 
		  was a blast to have around as he was up for any challenge or adventure 
		  whether it be streaking the backboard walk or eating 3 tables worth of 
		  spaghetti. We sadly lost Noah earlier in the summer, but we wish him 
		  luck in his football season as we were nicely surprised our 5&#8217;2 
		  scrawny and concussed boy made varsity.</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;

		  Finlay is an intensely curious human whose snazziness of dress is

		  a challenge. Whether she forgot to wait her tables, the difference 
		  between soup bowls and bread plates, or to show up for her job, 
		  Natasha is impossible to get upset with. She took a big leap this 
		  summer as she joined staff, and she took an even bigger leap and 
		  jumped off the O'donnells jumping rock. Through it all Natasha kept an 
		  uplifting attitude and a passion to improve. Natasha was quietly one

		  <p>We have had a busy week on the bay! Picnics, camp events, and staff 
		  activities happen every day! The weather the last few weeks has gotten 
		  pretty hot, but fortunately we had some rain this past week. Everyday 
		  more and more people arrive to the docks, and less people depart &#8211; we 
		  are gearing up for peak!<br><br>Last Saturday ICFC hosted a concert 
		  for the Friends of the Massassagua, which included a folk concert as 
		  well as a successful silent auction! This concert was a fundraiser to 
		  the support &#8220;The Friends&#8221; as they put their efforts into conserving 
		  the beautiful land of the Massassagua Park (which we are a park of!)<br>
		  <br>The Saturday Night party was hosted by the Coyle and Jenkins 
		  families, and it was a costume party! We had flocks of flamingos, a 
		  cowgirl, a robot, and a scary witch! We bobbed for apples, passed them 
		  between our necks, and the staff was tested on their ICFC Trivia! It 
		  was a large party, the entire camp seemed to be there enjoying the 
		  festivities!<br><br>The winners on Sunday Golf were Patty and Nick 
		  Steffey and Jaime Hugessen, and unfortunately the Softball Game was 
		  rained out! The Sunday Vespers service was done by John, Lisie, and 
		  Diehl Sillers, with musical help from Dave Bennett and Hannah Chapple. 
		  The service was centered around spirituality, and how everyone has to 
		  find their faith and spirituality for themselves. This service was 
		  impactful, because it really did promote that spirituality should not 
		  be &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; mentality, and that we all have our personal 
		  beliefs and doubts. <br><br>As the numbers of arrivals ramp up, the 
		  staff has been working more and more! We had two of our amazing staff 
		  members depart this week, Noah Petrick and Natasha Alexander. Both of 
		  these workers are tremendous in and out of the dining hall, and we 
		  thank them for a terrific few weeks on the Bay. Tonight, we will be 
		  welcoming back Finlay Gane and he will be here working on Staff until 
		  the end of camp! We were also lucky this week to be able to 
		  participate in two staff activities (thank you to the Brown family and 
		  the Brozeski family!). <br><br>On Wednesday there was a very 
		  informative Fire and Safety Training by Moe and Randy for the members 
		  and staff, and there will be another one this coming Wednesday! Please 
		  come and join us at 9am on the Main Dock to be rained! Also coming up 
		  this week are the Tolley Tennis Tournament, the Sillers Putting 
		  Tournament, a Barnim/Bartram sale, the Todd Cup, and the highly 
		  anticipated Hootenany (August 3rd!). We can&#8217;t wait for this busy week 
		  on the Bay!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		  <p>The boardwalk has been bustling with activity over the past week! 
		  Everyday groups of people head out to picnic on the rocks, to shred on 
		  wakes, and to catch more fish.<br><br>The Collins Conservations Cup 
		  had a great turn out, and the winning fish was 3lbs, caught by Mark 
		  Modic Jr! Carole Brammer also has been an active fisherman recently, 
		  every day at about&nbsp;11am&nbsp;she swings by the office to show us her new 
		  catch!<br></p>
		  <p>Our new tennis courts are done, and the players are heading up in 
		  packs. There have been wages set and games to be won! These gorgeous 
		  courts are dedicated to Nancy Runnells, and the dedication is on 
		  Friday, July 20th&nbsp;after lunch, and we encourage all members in camp to 
		  come. We have just received our new Pickleball Set, and the camp will 
		  be hosting a tournament in the next week to introduce the sport to our 
		  courts!<br></p>
		  <p>Michael Hugessen has joined our small staff (bringing us up to 9 
		  until our first departure next week! Jake Brown is the newest Waiter 
		  of the Week and as of yesterday, he officially out of his boot (he has 
		  been hobbling around on crutches since camp started!)! Catch him in a 
		  cow print apron all week, waiting up a storm in the dining hall! The 
		  staff also was able to tie dye with the Branch Family&nbsp;on Wednesday, 
		  and they all had a marvelous time!<br><br>The&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;Night party was 
		  a &#8220;hat theme&#8221; and was thrown by the Collins Family! We had a ball&#8230;they 
		  even got the 20+ group to pass around a lifesaver on toothpicks!&nbsp;On 
		  Sunday&nbsp;the weather was perfect for putting, and jumping in the water 
		  after a crazy softball game! The staff is now 1-3 (I am not going to 
		  even tell you the score), but we all had a grand time.<br><br>We ended 
		  our&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;with a vespers by Chip Crawford, with a wonderful 
		  introduction by John Boak, and we talked about keeping your calm when 
		  things get heated, and reminding yourself and others of love!<br></p>
		  <p>We are halfway through the season and are so excited for the 
		  upcoming events (Tolley Cup, Music in Massasagua Concert, and the 
		  Festival of the Sound!),<br><br>Best,&nbsp;<br>Hannah Chapple</p>

		  <p>This past week camp has been warm and active. The camp has been 
		  lively and more members and families come into our shore every day. On 
		  Wednesday of last week we celebrated the 4th of July with a great 
		  cookout by our new Kitchen, led by Chef Iggy. That night after some 
		  delicious flag cake, some of the members and staff went to see the 
		  celebratory fireworks in Lions Bay (curtesy of the Bogarts).&nbsp; <br>
		  <br>David Fritz, fishing wiz that he is, hosted a seminar Thursday 
		  night about drop shooting small mouth bass, which was informative and 
		  very, very fun. Hopefully all those who joined him have learned some 
		  skills that they can use in the upcoming Collins Conservation Cup! On 
		  Friday, we had the much anticipated Art Sale. It was a windy day, but 
		  it was all of the art in the lodge that blew us away! Some camp wide 
		  favorites returned including Scott Barnim, and we also welcomed some 
		  new artists to our sale including one of our own Alexis Rodefer!<br>
		  <br>On Saturday, the leadership team hosted the Saturday Night Party! 
		  We did a beach theme, and after a grand march, we played &#8220;pass the 
		  beach ball&#8221;, ice bucket relay, and Oliver Chapple showed the camp how 
		  he makes his favorite PB&amp;J&#8217;s (with the help of Noah Mackey&#8217;s arms). 
		  Sunday we had our weekly golf tournament, and softball! It was a 
		  gorgeous day for golf, the winners of the day were Berta Shroeder and 
		  David Mills for low net (lowest net of the season so far!), and Jaime 
		  Hugessen for low gross! The staff &#8220;won&#8221; softball&#8230; the score was 0-0 
		  because only 3 campers showed to play (shout out to Bobby Reigeluth, 
		  Jerry Rampelberg, and Dr. Bill Sager!)<br><br>That night we were 
		  treated to a thought provoking Vespers service done by Gary Johnson. 
		  He showed us all that even though we age quickly, that it&#8217;s the 
		  journey that really matters &#8211; and that we are all exactly where we 
		  should be. It was a beautiful way to end the week as the days up here 
		  fly by so fast. <br><br>Our new waiter of the week is Bridget 
		  McCarthy, who is a second year waiter! Bridget is our lovely flower 
		  girl, but she also works very hard in the dining hall and does her 
		  best to make our camp run as smoothly as possible! Catch her in a cow 
		  print apron all week, congrats Bridget!!</p>

		  <p>To our camp,<br></p>
		  <p>Happy Canada Day!<br><br>It has been a wonderful week for ICFC! The 
		  air is hot, the water is cold, and the fish are biting!<br><br>We had 
		  a few large catches over the last couple days, the largest being a 
		  5lb, 7 oz. small mouth bass caught by David Fritz! Every morning we 
		  start the day with amazing food from Chef Iggy (the bacon is 
		  delicious), and recently we have been ending the day with Taps played 
		  by Dana Savidge. <br><br>On Wednesday, Oliver Chapple and Noah Mackey 
		  hosted a Chapple Rainy Day Ping Pong Tournament! There were 28 
		  participants, and for the final match we watched a father- daughter 
		  showdown between John and Laurel Sager. Neither Laurel nor John showed 
		  any mercy, and that night John Sager came out as the champion (and the 
		  recipient of a fancy coffee mug)! The next day Renee Miller very 
		  enthusiastically hosted a game of bunko in the dining hall! We had 
		  over 70 players total; members, waiters, and kitchen staff &#8211; and it 
		  was a spectacular evening that ended in laughter and many, many, many 
		  candy bars. <br><br>The Saturday Night Party was hosted by the Fritz 
		  Family, the theme was Superhero&#8217;s! There were Power Rangers, 
		  Superman&#8217;s, Frozones, and a Wonder Woman! The activities were the 
		  grand march, and plenty of games for all ages (mummify the staff in 
		  toilet paper is always a riot).<br><br>We had a great turn out for 
		  Sunday Golf, and Kerry Todd and Sally DiNiord swept the competition, 
		  going home with all of the entry quarters! Softball was a great game 
		  (for the campers) (9-4), but the staff is working better together, and 
		  hopefully our team will rise up in the coming weeks! Last night, the 
		  Sunday Vespers were hosted by Sue Anne Morrow, and it was a short and 
		  sweet service with the main message being about the importance of 
		  saying thank you, being kind to others. <br><br>The first Waiter of 
		  the Week was Claire Cunningham, one of our first year waiters! She is 
		  a family friend of the Hugessens and although she has never been to 
		  ICFC before this year, she is doing really well! <br><br>Look for the 
		  next Bilge, next week brings new adventures such as the 4th of July, 
		  Book club, a Fishing Seminar, and the Art Show!<br><br>Rah Rah Ray<br>

		  <p>To our camp,<br><br>The first three days of the season were busy 
		  and beautiful! The Sager reunion is in full swing, and the dining hall 
		  is full of missed faces. The camp has been prepped for months by our 
		  hardworking Caretakers, and their staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I am being 
		  honest the grounds are looking great. The water levels are up by about 
		  10 inches, and it is noticeable as main dock is flat on the water.<br>
		  <br>All of our waiters are busy not only working, but also running 
		  around exploring and learning all about the traditions that our camp 
		  holds so dear. There are eight of them this year, and they are 
		  frequently seen in the dining hall, the arts and crafts room, the 
		  tennis courts, and in their eight hammock set up in Staff Land. We 
		  welcomed back Bridget McCarthy and Jake Brown as our second year 
		  waiters, and we are excited to have Alexandra Brozeski, Natasha 
		  Alexander, Oliver Chapple, Claire Cunningham, and our two Noahs&#8217; 
		  (Petrick and Mackey) working this summer.<br><br>After the very robust 
		  ringing of the welcome bell, The Saturday Night Party was very 
		  graciously hosted by Todd and Kathy Chapple.&nbsp; The theme for the 
		  night was &#8220;Your Best Iron City Garb&#8221;. The activities for the night 
		  were the Grand March, and elimination dance, and a game of &#8220;thaw and 
		  wear the frozen t -shirt&#8221; which brought out the competitive side of 
		  our Waiting Staff.&nbsp; <br><br>Sunday was a gorgeous day to enjoy 
		  softball and putting. We had 20 teams putting in the morning and the 
		  final winners were Sanders Bennett, and Howie &amp; Renee Miller. The 
		  softball game was very close, both teams playing extremely well, and 
		  it was tied up until the last inning when the Campers hit a grand slam 
		  home run and all of the loaded bases ran home. The final score was 
		  9-5, and staff can&#8217;t wait for their shot at redemption next week. Dr. 
		  Bill Sager gave a lovely Vespers service, centering his discussion 
		  surrounding a Tapestry he bought in Pakistan in the 1990&#8217;s. He spoke 
		  about how words and symbols connect all of us, and how symbols are 
		  just one commonality between all humans.<br><br>The Leadership Team is 
		  looking forward to the rest of the summer on the Georgian Bay, and we 
		  can&#8217;t wait to see all of our membership over the next few months! <br>
		  &nbsp;<br>All of the best, <br><br>Hannah Chapple (Camp Coordinator), 
		  Sanders Bennett (Bookkeeper), Dylan Martin, Luke McCarthy, and Harper 
		  Bennett (Head Waiters)</p>
