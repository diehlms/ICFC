	</b></font></u>The Last Daily Bilge 
	<p>Cheers To Another Great Summer on Georgian Bay!!!<br>
	<br>
	As we write this final bilge on the final morning of Iron City we like to 
	look at all of the spectacular events that occurred this past summer. 
	Whether it be from the wonderful Art Day to the day when Sans Souci kids 
	came over to play for the afternoon, each day at Iron City this summer was 
	something special. For the past week, we have been working to pack up camp. 
	We had an incredible <a href="../../../archive/other/PaddleWinners.htm">Paddle Dinner</a> where the great Robert Morrow took the 
	top prize of Paddle Winner. He was a great waiter and had a great attitude 
	in and out of the dining hall and we are all very proud of him. The Fab Five 
	could not have done their job without the support of the camp. We would like 
	to thank all of the campers for their generous donations to the staff fund 
	as well as the support you gave us throughout the entire summer. <br>
	<br>
	The Staff this year could not have been better. Each person had their own 
	great qualities to contribute. We had a great summer getting to know these 
	kids and could not have asked for a better bunch. We would also like to 
	thank Jim Beatty, Jay Douglass, and Christine Bennett for all of their 
	support and help. <br>
	<br>
	There are no better words to acknowledge the summer than a simple &#8220;Rah Rah 
	Ray.&#8221;<br>
	<br>
	Thanks Again for everything.<br>
	&#8220;But Another Summer&#8217;s Coming&#8230;..&#8221; </p>

	<br>
	<u><font size="4"><b>August 14, 2007:<br>
	</b></font></u>Greetings from Iron City!!<br>
	<br>
	On Saturday, there was the first annual Swim in which campers swam the Shark 
	in honor of Debbie Sawin. It was a great time as so many people showed up to 
	swim. Looking out from Garbage Hill was a sea of swimmers and colorful 
	kayaks that really made the swim something special. The Saturday Night Party 
	was a blast as Susan Kinnear had games and events for all ages. The Frogman 
	and the Pollywogs gave the live music for the event led by the Frogman 
	himself, Fred Crawford. Vespers on Sunday was delightful as always, led by 
	Robin Anderson. <br>
	<br>
	For the week ahead, Paddle Dinner Night is on Wednesday and the menu looks 
	exquisite. Chef has prepared and array of foods including beef, and seafood. 
	Iron City is beginning to dwindle even more these days as the final moments 
	of the Iron City summer are arriving. We are looking forward to seeing a few 
	more new faces as we come to a close this summer. We hope everyone had a 
	pleasant stay on the Georgian Bay and a great summer as well. <br>
	<br>
	Rah Rah Ray!

	Good Morning Iron City!!<br>
	<br>
	Last Night was a most eventful evening of music. We had the annual &#8220;Old 
	Friends&#8221; Hootenanny. Led by Nick Steffey and Alex Scott, the young and old 
	grooved to the always fun tunes like &#8220;Margaritaville&#8221; and the ever popular 
	&#8220;San Francisco Bay Blues.&#8221; The Back Boathouse was shaking all night and it 
	truly was a very enjoyable night for all in Iron City. <br>
	<br>
	This past week we have had the first annual Mary S. Scott Shuffle Board 
	Tournament which turned out to be a great one. Ricky Bergland and Bobby 
	Sillers came out champions as they defeated Tyler Steffey and Sam Sipe in 
	the finals. <br>
	<br>
	A lot of fish are being caught these days because every time we look out of 
	the office window we see that the weigh station is crowded with Bass and 
	Pike. Peak is starting to dwindle as the end of summer is approaching. We 
	still encourage anyone and everyone to make a quick last minute vacation up 
	here on the Bay. We hope that everyone is enjoying their summers because 
	things are going great up here in Camp. We hope to see you all soon.

	<br>
	<u><font size="4"><b><br>
	August 7, 2007:</b></font></u><br>
	There are just so many things to tell all of you about!<br>
	<br>
	We have had the busiest week here in Iron City. First off, the weather has 
	been fantastic. The thermometer has hit 90 degrees a few times and so the 
	swimming dock has been more crowded than ever. Picnics have been going out 
	to various islands daily and members have been so generous with taking staff 
	members out with them.<br>
	<br>
	The semi-annual meeting last Thursday was very well-attended, despite the 
	heat in the Lodge that night. All Committee heads informed the camp that all 
	was running well and that the summer was going very smoothly in nearly all 
	departments. Yay! Points for the Fab Five!<br>
	<br>
	Friday saw the annual Todd Cup Fishing Tournament. Some beautiful fish were 
	reeled in that day, that&#8217;s for sure! Charlie Stewart, the token Todd family 
	member in camp, gave honorable mention to David Fritz and Jeffrey Hugessen 
	for bringing in a stunning array of Georgian Bay bass. However, the lovely 
	Todd trophy did go to George Stronach III at the end of the day. Amazingly 
	enough, it was his fourth time winning the Todd Cup&#8230;wow! The Stronach and 
	Heath families were generous enough to host a cocktail party for all past 
	and present Todd Cup winners in camp last night. <br>
	<br>
	The Saturday Night Party, hosted by the Phillips, was held on Friday this 
	week due to a Georgian Bay Association Picnic that was occurring on 
	Saturday. The Party&#8217;s theme was &#8220;All things Harry Potter&#8221; and many wizards 
	and witches showed up to the Lodge that night. Many of us on Staff, 
	including all of the Fab Five, finished the last Harry Potter book in the 
	past week, so the Harry Potter party was a good end to a fabulous series.<br>
	<br>
	Saturday was perhaps the busiest day all summer. Not only were our numbers 
	the highest that night&#8230;185 campers, but it was also Artist Day as well as 
	the Tolley Cup&#8230;whew! With so much going on, all of our staff was quite busy 
	all day. Artist Day went incredibly well. We had five artists packed into 
	the Lodge, including Scott Barnim, our resident potter, Lori Skinner and her 
	wood carvings, Derek and Tracy Martin who brought iron sculptures, and 
	Michelle Prosek, with glass jewelry. The Lodge was packed all afternoon and 
	the artists heartily thanked everyone who helped out that day. <br>
	<br>
	The weather was fantastic for the Tolley Cup. It was hot but there was 
	definitely a slight breeze. We had sixteen teams play in the tournament that 
	last until Noon, with the finals playing right after lunch. The final round 
	included Charlie and Julia Stewart versus Sharon Chapple and Tyler Steffey. 
	It was an incredible match but Sharon and Tyler won out and gave a lovely 
	acceptance speech at dinner that night. <br>
	<br>
	Yesterday, our first staff member left for the summer. Zach Martin had to go 
	home to basketball and soccer camps but he will be sorely missed. Now that 
	one of us has left, it means that the summer is starting to wind down. We 
	have a few more waiters leaving this weekend, and as camper numbers drop, we 
	will slowly come to a close. <br>
	However, there are still things to look forward to! We in the office were 
	working on the Paddle Dinner menu and pamphlet this morning and the Sillers 
	Putting tournament is currently underway. <br>
	<br>
	The Duncan Anderson family hosted a bridge night last night that was still 
	going strong around 10:30PM&#8230;what a swinging crowd!<br>
	<br>
	As I sit here typing, our trusty internet guy, Craig is here trying to work 
	out the kinks of our wireless system. Let&#8217;s all hope for the best!<br>
	<br>
	The first lunch bell just rang, so we&#8217;re off, but here&#8217;s to a great rest of 
	the summer!<br>
	<br>
	Cheers, Your Fab Five</p>
	<p><br>
      <u><font size="4"><b>July 31, 2007:</b></font></u><br>
Cheers to Iron City!<br>
      <br>
Ladies and Gentlemen, we have reached our high for campers this summer
as the total amount of people who are here has come to 133. By
tomorrow, camp will be right up to 150 so we are glad that Iron City is
being prosperous. The weather has been fantastic and more and more
picnics are leaving for the Umbrellas and Teddy&rsquo;s each day. Last
night the entire staff participated in the biggest game of Capture the
Flag this summer. Kids are running around everywhere and it seems as
though nothing can be going wrong here on Georgian Bay. <br>
      <br>
Members, this is just a quick reminder that this Thursday, August 2nd,
is the semi-annual meeting. This Saturday is filled with events
including Art Day with six artists come up to show off their work as
well as the ever competitive Tolley Cup. Artists on Saturday include,
Scott Barnim with hand-made pottery, Lori Skinner with carved and
painted wood sculptures, and four other talented artists from the
Georgian Bay area. We hope to see all of you up to camp this week as it
is Peak. <br>

Good Morning to All ICFC Members and Guests:<br>


      
      
      <p>Greetings from Sodexho, Chef John, and the &ldquo;Summer of 2007&rdquo; Kitchen Staff!<br>


      <br>


This summer has proven to be another successful season for the
preparation of many delicious meals for &ldquo;Team
Sodexho&rdquo;.&nbsp; Last summer I was very excited to have been asked
to come to the Iron City Project, and take on the responsibilities of
working within this very unique environment.&nbsp; In my life I could
never imagine having been so lucky as to enjoy this beautiful
encampment, and trigger such wonderful memories to carry me through the
year&hellip;..and here we are back again!&nbsp; Everyone would ask me
&ldquo;What was it that you enjoyed the most&rdquo;?&nbsp; My only
reply was that I could not wait to get back to enjoy the most beautiful
sunsets I have ever experienced, and the one thing that I wanted to
enjoy the most was to feel the breezes off Georgian Bay!&nbsp; I did
not have to wait very long, as the first days and weeks of the 126
encampment have been cool and breezy!&nbsp; Definitely this summer has
been a definite change from the intense heat of last year!&nbsp; All of
us in the kitchen are thoroughly enjoying our more temperate work
conditions!<br>


      <br>


I hope that all of you are enjoying the varied menu items that make up
your meals here in the Dining Hall at ICFC.&nbsp; We are striving to
bring to you an array of tastes and flavors that will suffice your
appetites.&nbsp; If any of you have any special recipes that you would
like to pass along, please see me and I can incorporate these ideas
into the menu rotation.&nbsp; I will highlight these on the daily menu
as a special preparation for all to enjoy.&nbsp; I will also be
initiating a &ldquo;Guest Chef&rdquo; concept to allow my kitchen
employees to highlight their favorite foods and recipes, and under my
supervision they will prepare the meal menu and be responsible to see
it through service for your enjoyment.&nbsp; <br>


      <br>


My many duties now call me away from this issue of the &ldquo;Back Bay
Bilge&rdquo;.&nbsp; As this is my day off I will be able to spend some
time with my trusted friend &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo;.&nbsp; He was telling
me the other day how much he thoroughly enjoys the many friends he
meets, and how much he loves to ride in the boat!&nbsp; Today will be
our opportunity for another boat ride!&nbsp; <br>


      <br>


Wishing you all a very successful &ldquo;Summer of 2007&rdquo;!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see you all&hellip;&hellip; in the Dining Hall<br>


      <br>


Chef John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>


      <br>


      </p>


      <u><font size="4"><b>July 20, 2007:<br>




	</b></font></u>Wally here, barging in on the Bilge. 

	
      
      
      <p>Tallie and I just returned home (boohoo) from a great week in camp, with 

	weather all the way from the worst to best ever. What&rsquo;s wrong with that? If 

	it&rsquo;s nice &ndash; go to the Westerns, if not &ndash; have a nap or read a book. </p>




	
      
      
      <p>Our staff this year is one of the greatest, and I just thought I should 

	thank them all here in the bilge. The Five are doing a great job, the 

	waiters are too, and the Sodexho folks are providing fantastic meals. And 

	the Gregoires are keeping the physical plant humming along, cottages 

	spotless &ndash; and the putting green is the best I have ever seen. And Jim 

	Beatty is keeping close watch to make sure it all goes smoothly. </p>




	
      
      
      <p>THANK YOU ONE AND ALL! </p>




	
      
      
      <p>It looks like our camper days are running equal to last year, despite my 

	hopes that once the wireless internet was running we would have to set extra 

	tables in the dining hall. Help me out here! Get up to camp soon. I look 

	forward to spending plenty of quality time with you in August! </p>




	
      
      
      <p>We&rsquo;ll be back up July 31st for 2 weeks and hope to see you all at the 

	meeting. </p>




	
      
      
      <p>Happy Canada and Rah Rah RAY! </p>




	
      
      
      <p>W</p>




	<u><font size="4"><b>July 20, 2007:<br>


      </b></font></u>Good evening friends 

	and family!<br>




	<br>




	As we sit here in the Office digesting the delicious spare ribs that Chef 

	John prepared for dinner tonight, our excitement is mounting for the coming 

	week. Camper numbers are increasing drastically and we can&rsquo;t wait for the 

	Dining Hall to be bustling!<br>




	<br>




	The weather has been gorgeous the last few days and so many campers have 

	taken advantage of that with picnic lunches, water sports, and tanning on 

	the Swimming Dock.<br>




	<br>




	There was a Steak Picnic this past Wednesday at Pershings Point and they had 

	a gorgeous night for it, with a spectacular sunset. That same night, the 

	Staff Girls had a girls night out at Henry&rsquo;s. Because so many Members were 

	on the Steak Picnic, the kitchen staff girls came as well. Needless to say, 

	it was quite a crowd! And because Lisa Gregoire went with us, she had Moe 

	take us in his red cigarette boat from the 1970&rsquo;s. We all felt like we owned 

	the Bay as we zoomed around. To retaliate from the girls&rsquo; prank last week, 

	the Boys stole all of the girls&rsquo; clothes and piled them into the Martin 

	cabin. It took them a day or so to find it all and sort it out! Ah, staff 

	bonding&hellip;<br>




	<br>




	Well, it&rsquo;s almost 8pm and the Office is winding down. But we do have one 

	last thing to share with you all. Will was reminiscing about a song that 

	Thomas and Oliver Blecher sang to the Camp a few years back, when Molly 

	Steffey was coordinator. <br>




	<br>




	Please sing as you read, to the tune of &ldquo;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&rdquo;:<br>




	<br>




	Here we are on Georgian Bay<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beach we play all day.<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the park with slide and swing<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With friend Molly, camp songs we 

	sing.<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ride a boat and catch a fish,<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never leave, that is our wish.<br>




	<br>




	Please come see us soon!<br>




	<br>




	Georgian Bay lovin&rsquo;,<br>

	<u><font size="4"><b>July 17, 2007:<br>




	</b></font></u>Top Ten Reasons Why A Summer on Staff at ICFC is the Best Job 

	Ever:<br>




	10. You have access to as much breakfast bacon as is humanly possible.<br>




	9. Staff boys are always willing to throw people in. Always.<br>




	8. Going to bed at one in the morning is considered early.<br>




	7. The Crispy Crunch and the Mr. Big become two new food groups.<br>




	6. All campers ages 10 and under can&rsquo;t wait to be you and all campers 50 and 

	over wish that they still were you.<br>




	5. While various friends spend countless hours at their internships sitting 

	at a desk in front of a computer, you spend countless hours in khakis and 

	whites singing and dancing to &ldquo;Tiny Dancer&rdquo; by Elton John.<br>




	4. Sans Souci begins to know you by &ldquo;those kids who come in twice a week and 

	order massive quantities of ice cream.&rdquo;<br>




	3. A picnic lunch at Teddy&rsquo;s with a BLT, a book, and your bathing suit is 

	your idea of an afternoon well spent.<br>




	2. You come to think of the mice in Staffland as your roommates, not your 

	enemies.<br>




	1. The memories you make in one summer last you all the way through the 

	school year.<br>




	<u><font size="4"><b><br>




	<br>




	July 14, 2007:<br>




	</b></font></u>Ahoy there, matees!<br>




	<br>




	We&rsquo;ve had a jam-packed week here at our beloved Camp, so we apologize for 

	not keeping you better informed of our various activities. On Tuesday, the 

	Staff Boys decided to take their traditional Boys Night Out since the 

	numbers were still on the lower side. So Moe accompanied them to Henry&rsquo;s 

	Fish restaurant for some battered pickerel and a sundry other fried foods. 

	Our girls may seem innocent, but they sure had some tricks up their sleeves. 

	While serving dinner, they conjured up a prank for the ages, including 

	clothes strung up the flag pole as well as a few choice undergarments frozen 

	in ice in the kitchen&rsquo;s freezer. It would be an understatement to say that 

	the boys returned with quite a surprise! <br>




	<br>




	That same night, there was a thunderstorm for the ages. The Staff had a 

	great time watching the rain move across the Bay from the safety of our 

	trusty Dining Hall. It was the act of getting soaked while sprinting back to 

	our staff cabins that we probably could have done without!<br>




	<br>




	On Wednesday, the Staff ventured out to Parry Sound. It was quite a bumpy 

	ride, to say the least! But we all had fun riding the waves and arriving on 

	the dock a bit damp! We had lunch at The Sound Grill House and had none 

	other than Kate Beatty as our waitress. It was nice to get off our island 

	for the afternoon, being able to roam around Parry Sound. Our Staff came 

	back with the necessities, including water guns, water balloons, 

	disappearing ink, jawbreakers, and bubble gum.<br>




	<br>




	The Sloans are here, which means picnics galore for the Staff, including one 

	to the Umbrellas and one to Pomeroy Island, near Teddy&rsquo;s Rock. <br>




	<br>




	Chef John served eggs Benedict for breakfast today&mdash;his hollandaise sauce is 

	not one to be reckoned with!<br>




	<br>




	As you can see, we&rsquo;ve been quite busy up here and we can&rsquo;t wait for it to 

	become even busier in the next few weeks!<br>




	<br>




	Don&rsquo;t forget to come by and visit us in the office, especially now that 

	we&rsquo;ve gotten a new shipment of long sleeved T-shirts! <br>




	<br>




	Signing off for now,<br>




	Your Fab Five</p>

	<br>




	It was a Miller family kind of weekend this weekend. The staff put on Bunko 

	for the camp on Friday night, usually an activity sponsored by the sorely 

	missed Howie Miller family. &ldquo;BUNKO!!&rdquo; was heard all the way down the 

	boardwalk, and I&rsquo;m sure it resonated across the Bay. Laura Burke, helped out 

	by Marten and Lucy Jenkins held a Pajama-themed Saturday Night Party. It was 

	complete with relays and the ever-popular adult game, &ldquo;identify your spouse 

	by their arm&rdquo;. Vespers was hosted by Gary and Kathy Johnson. Gary spoke 

	eloquently about the importance of friendship. The service concluded as a 

	downpour began. <br>




	<br>




	This morning&rsquo;s breakfast was peaceful and relaxed. It rained briefly during 

	the meal but now the sun is back out and there is great anticipation for a 

	day that will include fishing for many of our campers, a picnic with the 

	Sloans, and maybe even a ski on the glassy bay. As a member of the Fab Five 

	I can hardly believe that we have already been here for nearly four weeks. 

	Right now if you take a walk along the boardwalk after dinner only the 

	occasional porch is occupied but soon more families and friends will begin 

	to arrive and the table count in the dining hall will only rise until the 

	end of peak. Until then we are enjoying these lovely, lazy days. </p>




	
      
      
      <p>&ldquo;And gathered from afar<br>




	Friends tried and true there are,<br>




	Will ever be-&ldquo; </p>




	
      
      
      <p>See you all soon.<br>

	</b></font></u>Happy Canada Day and Happy 4th of July!<br>




	<br>




	This week has certainly been full of activities! On Sunday, we had a Canada 

	Day barbeque in the evening, complete with a beautiful cake in the shape of 

	a Canadian flag. The weather wasn&rsquo;t completely cooperative, but we still had 

	a great rendition of &ldquo;O Canada&rdquo;.<br>




	<br>




	Yesterday, the weather was rainy and chillier for the American holiday, but 

	that certainly didn&rsquo;t dampen campers&rsquo; spirits. It cleared up in the evening 

	and Monty Scott was generous enough to put on fireworks from Pikes Peak at 

	dusk. Everyone gathered on the Beach and &ldquo;ooh&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;ahh&rsquo;s&rdquo; could be heard 

	a mile away. <br>




	<br>




	Arts and Crafts was also very busy for these two celebrations. The dining 

	hall has been adorned with many hand-painted flags.<br>




	<br>




	It looked as if the weather was going to again disappoint us this morning as 

	it was foggy and on the colder side, but this afternoon proved to be 

	beautiful and the volleyball game that was supposed to occur yesterday went 

	on today with a few games, campers vs. staff.<br>




	<br>




	The Reed Reunion is at full tilt and &ldquo;Grammy Reed&rsquo;s fudge&rdquo; was served to the 

	whole family tonight for dinner. I don&rsquo;t think it had been made in many 

	years, but it looked incredible!<br>




	<br>




	Tomorrow will prove to be a busy day as well. Gary Johnson and Barbara 

	Boucek are planning a Crispy Crunch fishing tournament for the morning and a 

	huge camp-wide Bunko game will be going on tomorrow night.<br>




	<br>




	As you can see, we&rsquo;ve all been very busy up here, and we can&rsquo;t wait to see 

	you all. Get those reservations in early!<br>




	<br>




	Lots of Bay love,<br>

	</b></font></u>Greetings and Salutations! This weekend was a good-ole 

	fashioned Iron City weekend. On Saturday the Strickers and Chapples hosted a 

	fantastic Saturday night party with the theme of your favorite hate. Dave 

	Reed came into the party with a basketball net on his head. It made for a 

	great time. Sunday was great with a morning of golf and an afternoon of 

	Softball. Sadly the campers beat the staff but in the end everyone enjoyed 

	themselves. Last night was the first time the chef prepared a Sunday evening 

	picnic. It was a bit windy so we ate inside but it was a great meal 

	buffet-style. Camp is growing immensely as the Reed reunion comes closer and 

	closer, so we encourage everyone to mark down iron city on their calendars 

	and make some reservations. We hope the summer is going well for everyone. 

	See you all on the Bay.<br>

	</b></font></u>Ahoy from Iron City! This week has been stupendous so far. 

	The weather has been fantastic and the Staff has been out on the water 

	nearly every afternoon with either a wakeboard or a tube. The swimming dock 

	has been quite crowded and many a staffer or camper has come into dinner 

	with quite a sunburn! Camp is low in numbers but slowly growing and this 

	weekend should see higher numbers, partly because of the holiday, and partly 

	because of the Reed reunion. Chef John has been working hard creating an 

	inventive menu for the holiday weekend and we think that a Beach Day may be 

	in order. <br>




	<br>




	A new TV was just recently put into the Lodge since the Old Faithful finally 

	died at the beginning of the season. The Staff has already christened the 

	new one by watching a movie last night and since I was on duty, I painted my 

	toenails.<br>




	<br>




	Dave wants to remind everyone to get their reservations in early and to 

	increase those camper days! That Iron City clothing line is disappearing 

	fast!<br>




	<br>




	I think I hear the pitter patter of Oliver Chapple coming up the office 

	steps, so I&rsquo;m off.<br>




	<br>




	I hope everyone is doing well and we can&rsquo;t wait to see all of you on the 

	Bay!<br>

	<u><font size="4"><b>June 25, 2007:<br>




	</b></font></u>Hello Iron Citians!<br>




	<br>




	We have had a stellar beginning of camp. We all made it through our first 

	weekend, complete with all of the usual festivities. The Saturday Night 

	Party was hosted by the McCarthy family and featured the theme &ldquo;Stars and 

	Stripes Forever&rdquo;. We may have been a small group that night, but there was 

	plenty of laughter and fun had by all, not to mention the number of Yummy 

	Dummy candies that were consumed! Although the Staff severely outnumbered 

	the campers for our softball game yesterday, we played a few innings anyway, 

	featuring the all-star powerhouses, Mackenzie and Steven Gregoire. Vespers 

	was led by your new Fab Five team and we decided to talk about adventure and 

	gaining a new perspective. Will and Dave Scott talked at length about their 

	trip to Africa, specifically the climb up Mt. Kilimanjaro. Vespers this 

	Sunday was sans-piano player, but nevertheless, our a capella-style hymn was 

	quite moving. <br>




	<br>




	We now have a wide array of ICFC clothing, and your personal shopping 

	advisors here in the Office will be glad to give you their professional 

	opinions. <br>




	<br>




	Camper days, camper days, camper days, people! We all want to see your 

	shining faces!<br>




	<br>




	Until we meet again&hellip;<br>




	<br>




	Your coordinating duo, Will and Eleanor<br>




	&nbsp;</p>

	</b></font></u>Greetings from the Bay!<br>




	<br>




	As we sit here in the office, we hear the playful banter of the McCarthy 

	twins, probably slightly annoying to their storekeeper brother, Brandon. We 

	observe Chef John frantically looking for white out to correct his brilliant 

	and creative menu. Gregg Scott has already bought several items from the 

	assorted clothing line in the Office. Obviously, camp has started and is in 

	full swing! <br>




	<br>




	Last night&rsquo;s dinner was delicious and the forecast for the menus to come is 

	sunny side up! The wait staff has been hard at work and training in the 

	dining hall has been quite rigorous. By the time you get to Camp, these kids 

	will be machines and you&rsquo;ll even want to donate to the Staff Fund (hint, 

	hint!). <br>




	<br>




	The weather has been chilly and somewhat windy but today is calm and sunny 

	and Will has promised the staff boys that a trip to Blackstone is in order.<br>




	<br>




	Our loyal book keeper Dave reminds all of you to get your reservations in 

	early because he is just DYING for some work to do.<br>




	<br>




	We can&rsquo;t wait for all of you to get up here and for camp to get busier by 

	the week!<br>




	<br>




	Rah Rah Ray!<br>




	<br>




	-Your new Fab Five: Eleanor, Emily, Maggie, Will, and Dave.
