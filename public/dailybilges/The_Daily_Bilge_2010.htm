  		<u><font size="4"><b><br>August 20, 2010:</b></font></u><p class="style1">
		  As this is the final installment of the Bilge for this summer, we have 
		  much to discuss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, to 
		  the communications committee!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">Chip Crawford has asked that I remind everyone to 
		  take a glance at the Iron City website.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>On the site, one will find the Member Survey.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>This takes an average of 20 minutes, and is more helpful than 
		  you know.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Please complete 
		  a survey if you have not already.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Now, to the main event!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">Paddle Dinner was Thursday, August 12th.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The waiters and kitchen spent the prior week preparing for the 
		  occasion, and it showed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  </span>Chef John Saunders orchestrated a wonderful three-course meal, 
		  with the desert of &#8220;Memories of a Georgian Bay Sunset&#8221; as the coup de 
		  grace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Many thanks and 
		  hats off to Chef John and his fine kitchen staff for another summer of 
		  pleasing our palettes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We 
		  are grateful to have you, John!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">The evening progressed, with accolades and hurrahs 
		  bandied about to the Gregoires and their respective staffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Thank you so much for what you do, because I cannot bear to 
		  think about where we might be without your effort and dedication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Congratulations to the entire Gregoire clan on 20 years of 
		  service in Iron City, and good luck on the next 20 years!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">Thank you also to Mr. Beatty, whose business savvy 
		  leads this club to greater heights each year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I would personally express my gratitude to Mr. Beatty for his 
		  patience and presence in the office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>He is a strong-willed individual with an indomitable work 
		  ethic, and we are all better off because of him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Thank you, thank you, and thank you.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">Before we get to the big reveal, I&#8217;m going to direct 
		  some of the spotlight on Emily Boak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Our resident musician on staff, Emily played the evening hymns 
		  on the piano nearly every night, and also performed at many Vespers 
		  services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On top of all 
		  that, Emily was the one you heard each evening at 10:00 PM, serenading 
		  camp with &#8220;Taps&#8221; on her flute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>She is an impressive young woman who deserves great praise for 
		  her devotion and enthusiasm this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I thank you for your service to Iron City; we all know what a 
		  special place this is for you.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">As we whittled our way through the program and 
		  filled our tummies with delicacies, the only thing left to do was give 
		  away a Paddle Award.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our 
		  winner is a waiter who truly exemplified the spirit of Iron City 
		  Fishing Club in their willingness to listen, learn, and cooperate, 
		  inside and outside of the dining hall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>This individual has pep in her step, takes pride in her job, 
		  and has a passion for the traditions of our camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>After a meticulous counting and recounting of votes, the 2010 
		  Paddle Award was given to Mei Raley!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>While there were other nominees with many votes, Mei was our 
		  winner this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As 
		  tradition dictates, Mei was handed the Paddle, congratulated, and then 
		  promptly tossed into the bay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The next time you see her, be sure to give Mei a big hug or a 
		  high-five, she deserves it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="style1">Camp has dwindled down to our last few dozen for the 
		  season.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The days are still 
		  and the nights are clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  The stars at night shine together in a chorus of light, pulling 
		  campers into warm dreams of summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  </span>The windswept pines, the watchful guardians of the shorelines, 
		  beckon our boats to turn around and rejoin them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>But we must depart and reacquaint ourselves with work and 
		  school, so that we may return stronger in mind and spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>May we all find health and happiness in the real world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Enjoy the winter chores, and remember that tradition is a 
		  mighty thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></p>

		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  Hello from Georgian Bay!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I 
		  am happy to report that peak is poking!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I apologize for the tardiness of this Bilge, but it was an 
		  eventful week.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  The cooler weather has tiptoed in, providing for some lovely sleeping 
		  weather.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a welcome 
		  change from all the still and humid days earlier this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Well, let us recap this past week&#8217;s adventures in Iron City:</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  The Sunday afternoon softball game was a lopsided affair, to say the 
		  very least.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the big 
		  bats were present, and I believe a record number of softballs were 
		  launched onto the new tennis courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The poor tennis players were constantly dodging a downpour of 
		  homeruns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was painful 
		  to watch the camper lead increasing with seemingly every at-bat, but 
		  the Staff soldiered on, keeping the aspiration to victory alive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The final score was a dreary 16-1, or in simpler terms, &#8220;Lots 
		  and Lots&#8221; to &#8220;Ben Sager.&#8221;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  That&#8217;s correct; Ben Sager hit yet another inside-the-park homerun, but 
		  it wasn&#8217;t enough to stop the insatiable camper offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>If only we could have a team of robo-Ben Sagers, and maybe 
		  clone him a bunch as well.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  To continue our review of the other competitions this past week, the 
		  Todd Cup had the fisher people hopping into their boats and bounding 
		  through the bay, in search of all the fishies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>While valiant efforts were forged, George Stronach III walked 
		  out of the dining hall that evening with a smile and his name on the 
		  Todd Cup. </span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  As for the Sillers Putting Tournament, the field of 20 was whittled 
		  down to the final match between Mac Reed and Alex Scott.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>With a gallery gathered by the putting green, Mac edged out 
		  Alex to claim victory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
		  dark horse competitor in this tournament was Jack Phillips, as he cut 
		  down veteran putters the likes of John Sillers and Cynnie Rampelberg.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span></span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  The Tolley Tennis Tournament was full of some great matches and fun 
		  teams to watch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The new 
		  tennis courts saw lots of use because of rain the previous evening, so 
		  thank you to all of those tennis fans who helped to get that off (and 
		  into) the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
		  final match of this tournament was the favored duo of Loren Musgrove 
		  and Bobby Sillers playing against the upstart squad of Megan Collins 
		  and Mac Reed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bobby and 
		  Loren were just too much handle for Mac and Megan, and are this 
		  summer&#8217;s Tolley Tennis Tournament champions.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  Congratulations to all the competitors and victors, it was a fun week 
		  for sports fans!</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  Camp is slowly inching towards August 21<sup>st</sup>, our last 
		  breakfast, but there is still time!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Come for a long weekend, or the odd Tuesday, it doesn&#8217;t matter!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We have some exciting things this weekend with Paddle Dinner on 
		  Thursday and the Old Friends Night on Friday, and you don&#8217;t want to 
		  miss those.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I have a 
		  credible source who told me that Stevie Gregoire is a lead candidate 
		  for the paddle, based solely on his dinosaur and kitten impressions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>That&#8217;s all for now, </span>
		  <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">

  		<u><font size="4"><b><br>July 29, 2010:<br></b></font></u><p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  Good Day, faithful readers!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I bring you glad tidings from a blustery Georgian Bay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Boy-oh-boy, were the winds a-whoopin&#8217; and a-hollerin&#8217; 
		  yesterday; a proper July day in Iron City, indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  </span>Camp is certainly trickling in more every day, but it isn&#8217;t the 
		  deluge of campers we&#8217;ve been expecting.</span></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  The Bushkoffs hosted a Harry Potter-themed Saturday Night Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Plenty of wizards and various other nonsensical creatures made 
		  an appearance at this magical extravaganza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The last game of the night was a doozy: Harry Potter Jeopardy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Featuring categories like &#8220;Characters,&#8221; &#8220;Spells,&#8221; and 
		  &#8220;Miscellaneous,&#8221; young people were divided into competing teams and 
		  pitted against each other in a battle of brains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>By the slimmest of margins Team Gryffindor pulled out the 
		  victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Personally, I 
		  was amazed by the wealth of knowledge my peers possess about this 
		  Harry Potter fellow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I 
		  know that he is a magic wizard with a silly birthmark, and that is the 
		  extent of my familiarity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Now, if someone were to propose a BATMAN theme for a Saturday Night 
		  Party, a certain Office Coordinator would be very satisfied&#8230;.</span></p>

		  Sunday was nice and quiet, as tradition dictates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Well, I did bend the rules a tickle in order to pick up our 
		  newest addition to wait staff, Ben Sager.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>After spending 36 hours in transit from Ashland, Oregon, Ben 
		  pulled into MacTier a weary traveler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We arrived at the Main Dock at 3:00 PM, just in time for the 
		  weekly softball match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By 
		  3:25 PM, Ben was jogging into home plate, having just hit an 
		  inside-the-park homerun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  TRUE STORY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with 
		  this astounding feat, the resolution of this match was more than a bit 
		  lopsided in favor of those awful campers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The final score was &#8220;Many&#8221; to &#8220;We Should Brush Up On Our 
		  Defensive Positioning.&#8221;</span></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  Sunday evening Vespers was led by the Firestone family this week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We discussed the significance of a prayer, no matter the 
		  duration or length.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A 
		  prayer is a prayer, no matter how small!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>There was a slight technologic twist with this service, as Jeff 
		  Firestone was reading from his Apple iPad.</span></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
		  Well, we certainly have lots of exciting things happening very soon: 
		  the Tolley Tennis Tournament, the Scott Shuffleboard Tournament, and 
		  our Semi-Annual Meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Your attendance is requested at ALL of these events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Also, a reminder:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Please inform us office-folk of your reservations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Chef John likes to feed people, and he also likes to know how 
		  many people to feed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Come 
		  for the food, stay for the NEW CHAIRS!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>That&#8217;s right folks, the new dining hall chairs have arrived!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>That&#8217;s all for now, but stay tuned for more to follow, dear 
		  readers!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Enjoy your 
		  summer and join us soon!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  COUGH (batman-themed Saturday night party) COUGH.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
		  </span>Just a bit of a cough there.</span></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">

  <u><font size="4"><b><br>July 23, 2010:</b></font></u><p>I know this is a fishing 
		  club, but boy this summer&#8217;s catches have been incredible!! Not a day 
		  goes by without the click of stringers and the groan of the fishing 
		  scale outside of the store.&nbsp; Beyond the normal wave of expert 
		  fisherpeople the Collins family hosted the Tom Collins Conservation 
		  Cup on Wednesday, challenging the campers to find the largest 
		  smallmouth bass in the bay. Lynn Todd Edgerton caught the winner, a 
		  whopping 2lb 15oz smallmouth bass, just off of Birch Island. Cathy, 
		  Rip, and Ina Sable kept the camp on their toes and brought in some 
		  bass of their own (Rip&#8217;s was 2lb 8oz and Ina caught a 2lb 14oz).</p>
		  <p>The staff returned from their adventure in Parry Sound exhausted, 
		  napping as Moe guided us home on the Iron City, but quickly revived 
		  themselves at the thought of an outing to Henry&#8217;s. The girls headed 
		  out accompanied by the kitchen staff women who were liberated for the 
		  evening to enjoy fish, friends, and fried food. Stewart helped cover 
		  the shorthanded staff in the kitchen, practically the next Gordon 
		  Ramsay. Bruce tied back his hair and took on the role of Headwaiter 
		  for the evening. &nbsp;The staff boys will have their excursion on Friday. 
		  Todd Chapple and Dave Bennett generously took the staff out to the 
		  front bay and dragged them behind some boats for an afternoon or two, 
		  tubing, skiing, etc.</p>
		  <p>Our Saturday Night Party was Bastille Day Themed&#8212;come as your 
		  favorite French person, place, or thing&#8212;and lead by the Jake Brown 
		  family. The Modic clan surpassed all other costumes with their 
		  representation of Beauty and the Beast. The Brown&#8217;s required that the 
		  staff use their brain for their game, ordering five items by 
		  temperature (low to high) and &nbsp;countries by coastline length (largest 
		  to smallest). Many came close, none were perfect, but they DO know 
		  that your coffee is hot!</p>
		  <p>Wally and Laura Jenkins lead a peaceful vespers service, bringing a 
		  favorite hymn from home to share with the ICFC family. They discussed 
		  the support systems in place to help lift us up like Zacchaeus had the 
		  sycamore tree. The staff needed a calm evening after a difficult 
		  battle on the softball field. We lost to the campers in a close 2-1 
		  game. It&#8217;s encouraging to have enough campers to field a team on their 
		  own for once but the numbers can always been added to. Come on up and 
		  help out because the staff will not take defeat quietly!</p>

  		  <u><font size="4"><b><br>July 14, 2010:</b></font></u><p>Good day from the Bay!&nbsp; 
		  It is the middle of July, and Camp is getting quiet.&nbsp; Too quiet.&nbsp; 
		  So quiet, in fact, that the staff is departing for a day trip to the 
		  booming metropolis of Parry Sound this morning.&nbsp; But Oh!&nbsp; 
		  What treasures and mysteries await us in this Northern hamlet?&nbsp; 
		  Moccasins?&nbsp; Fried food?&nbsp; Knicks?&nbsp; Knacks?&nbsp; Certain 
		  DOOM?!?&nbsp; But anyway, we&#8217;re looking forward to our trip.</p>
		  <p>The weather is warm, and the humidity is certainly getting in the 
		  way.&nbsp; We had a spot of rain, but no breeze to relieve us from the 
		  heat.&nbsp; The water has been so warm that at this point, it is 
		  almost easier to go jump in the Bay than the shower in the mornings.&nbsp; 
		  Yesterday at Sherrill Dock, the ladder thermometer read 78 degrees.&nbsp; 
		  Yowza!</p>
		  <p>The Saturday Night Party was a Staff initiative, and included a 
		  variation of the newly-wed game:&nbsp; the Sibling Game.&nbsp; The 
		  real winners of this game: the spectators.&nbsp; We ended with an 
		  elimination dance set to the tune of the Pittsburgh Polka.&nbsp; 
		  &#8220;We&#8217;re from the town with a great football team&#8230;..duh duh DUH DUH!&nbsp; 
		  We cheer the PITTSBURGH STEELERS!&#8221;&nbsp; But anyway, Go Steelers.</p>
		  <p>The First Sunday Campers Vs. Staff Softball Game of the Year 
		  finally commenced at 3 o&#8217;clock on Sunday, and what a stirring contest 
		  it was!&nbsp; An 8-0 camper lead at the end of the first inning hinted 
		  at landslide victory, but how these numbers deceive!&nbsp; After a few 
		  strong staff bats at the plate, that lead slimmed down to 8-6.&nbsp; 
		  The final score of this barnstormer was 15-12, with the campers 
		  snatching victory from jaws of defeat.&nbsp; Jack Huber recorded the 
		  complete game as the camper pitcher, so please note this in your 
		  programs.&nbsp; A good showing by all, except on defense!</p>
		  <p>Sunday Vespers was a cooperative venture between the Branches and 
		  Jay Douglass.&nbsp; Ted brought the hymns, and Jay brought the 
		  thunder.&nbsp; We discussed written sets of set of laws through the 
		  years, and how the previous iterations have influenced the most 
		  recent, up to how we can condense &#8220;self-help&#8221; motivation.&nbsp; Jay 
		  referenced the Magna Carta.&nbsp; HISTORY.</p>
		  <p>Don Lawson has been bringing in the bass like a master fisherman.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		  Everyone else just seems to be catching bug bites.</p>
		  <p>Please send us some reservations, we want those camper days to go 
		  up.&nbsp; We hope you all were able to witness the Spanish win their 
		  first World Cup victory and watch LeBron slink down to South Beach, 
		  the slimy so-and-so.&nbsp; As you drift off to sleep this very eve, I 
		  will leave you all with a final thought to pervade your dreams: 
		  &#8220;Caaaamper daaaays, caaaaaaamper daaaysss.&#8221;</p>

  		<u><font size="4"><b><br>July 6, 2010:</b></font></u><p>Wawa-Weewa!&nbsp; What a 
		  wondrous, wild, whirlwind weekend&nbsp; t&#8217;were!&nbsp; We got hit with 
		  a 3.5 Day Blow, which required our July 1st celebratory Canada Day 
		  cookout to be pushed inside.&nbsp; Burgers and hotdogs were a-flying &#8211; 
		  literally!&nbsp; As if on cue, a dozen Mounties on moose-back galloped 
		  in formation through the dining hall during our rendition of &#8220;Oh, 
		  Canada!&#8221;</p>
		  <p>The next day, Camp held an honorary cocktail party and dinner for 
		  the Gregoires, the guardian angels of Iron City.&nbsp; For those 
		  unaware, this is Gary, Florence, and Moe Gregoire&#8217;s 20th year of 
		  service at Iron City Fishing Club.&nbsp; After a rousing cocktail 
		  party in the Lodge, the Paddle was awarded to Gary and Florence at 
		  dinner to the tune of a hearty &#8220;Rah Rah Ray!&#8221;&nbsp; We will be 
		  observing this milestone anniversary all year, so bring your gratitude 
		  and thanks to Camp, they deserve it.</p>
		  <p>On July 3rd, Scott Barnim arrived for an afternoon of pottery.&nbsp; 
		  Joining Scott this time were Derek and Tracey Martin, who offered 
		  garden art-type wares.&nbsp; As always, the artists left very happy!&nbsp; 
		  Circle August 6th on your calendars, as this is Scott Barnim&#8217;s next 
		  date in Iron City.&nbsp; Pottery:&nbsp; GET SOME!<br>That night we had 
		  a Saturday Night Party/Hootenanny amalgamation spearheaded by Laura 
		  Burke and Alex Scott.&nbsp; We played some old standards, with a few 
		  newer ones.&nbsp; Thanks to Peter Amerman, Ben Johnson, Dick Boak, 
		  Bill Sager, Jack Huber, and Sam Applegate for providing the merry 
		  melodies.&nbsp; Everybody brought their own flair.</p>
		  <p>The NEXT day was July 4th, or its equivalent in the film industry, 
		  &#8220;Independence Day.&#8221;&nbsp; We enjoyed the traditional Sunday Dinner, 
		  and attempted to get a good old, American-as-apple-pie game of 
		  softball underway, but campers were not to be found.&nbsp; So we 
		  played kickball instead.&nbsp; Gary Johnson led Camp in Vespers with 
		  an American Revolution-themed sermon.&nbsp; We delved into the 
		  convictions and ideals of our Founders, while relating these 
		  characteristics to Biblical figures.&nbsp; After Vespers, we paid 
		  tribute to two of America&#8217;s fondest past-times: boating and explosions 
		  (separately, of course).&nbsp; Camp was invited by Clare Bogart&#8217;s 
		  family to watch fireworks from their cottage in Lion&#8217;s Head Bay.&nbsp; 
		  Fun and colorful explosions were had by all.</p>
		  <p>Camp is slowing down a bit with the departure en masse by the 
		  Miller/Burke/Johnson/Sager/Patton/Savidge Reunion.&nbsp; We still have 
		  plenty of shirts, sweaters, vests, hats, and Mr. Bigs.&nbsp; The fish 
		  are biting and the trampoline is bouncy, so call or email your 
		  reservations to the Office Folks.&nbsp; Won&#8217;t you come spend some time 
		  with us?<br>&nbsp;<br>The Best and the Jolliest,<br>Stewart P. Bennett,
