  <font size="4"><u><b> August 23, 2005:</b></u></font><p>The End is upon us. Today, as surely you have noted, is the final day of 
  camp for the 2005 season. It is only the early morn of the day as I embark upon writing this final Bilge, but it promises to be a 
  beautiful day. The bay is calm, the skies are blue with puffy clouds hovering above, and the temperature is steadily rising. These 
  past few days of camp have been a double sided coin, filled with fast and furious moments of fun and excitement, paired with a few 
  hours of napping, relaxation, and occasional boredom. But despite the double nature of these days, they provide a wonderful gift 
  for those who have been up here all or most of the summer. Seeing the camp close presents a certain closure and comfort to the 
  summer&#8217;s end and provides the time to reflect on the meaning of everything that has happened here. It is like in the end of 
  &#8216;Return of the Jedi,&#8217; Luke Skywalker burning the body of Darth Vader in silent contemplation of the true nature of this complex 
  man. Well, in a sense, that&#8217;s what we are doing now, here in Iron City; we are burning Darth Vader, sending a summer up in flames 
  to the dream realms from which it came, as we silently think of its complex messages. Just as easy as this summer sailed into all 
  of our lives, it will just as simply sail away leaving only a whirlpool of shape, color, and memory in its wake and we must take 
  from it what we can. </p>
  <p>This summer has done nothing but sing its heart out for us. And hearing it sing has been a marvelous time. It has sung many 
  miracles and many hopes for future summers. Walking into the brand new Dining Hall, swimming at night, Mike Winn&#8217;s big fish, 
  turning on and off lights, Kathryn Kerr Todd&#8217;s poetry, tubing on a windy day, half the camp reading Harry Potter, The Gregoires, 
  seeing Stan Williams arriving in Camp, the multi-layered kitchen staff, Don Sillers&#8217; &#8220;Old Guys Rule&#8221; T-Shirt, kayaking near the 
  sunset, love gained and love lost, all these are the small miracles a summer is founded upon. They have brought smiles to our 
  faces and motion to our muscles; they have accompanied our laughter and our tears. These miracles that walk with us each day are 
  what keep us walking. They help us to find new treasures and open new doors, lead us to better understandings, and better senses 
  of humor. They provide the magic that the young believe in and the old know exist. And it is our privilege to hold on to these 
  memories and miracles with deep compassion, and share them with future generations in the hope they too might discover more. </p>
  <p>It has been my privilege in these past days to have thought long and hard of the purpose and meaning this summer has had in my 
  life, and so far, I have found no clear answer. Yet, I have taken solace in the notion that perhaps there is no grand meaning to 
  this summer, perhaps it was just plain fun and maybe forcing some big lesson learned or big idea behind a summer would be 
  inadequate to explain what really went on here. I find contentment in being satisfied with no greater knowledge after this summer 
  and I smile to think that in time and memory, I shall someday figure out what I was doing here and share it with others. </p>
  <p>Until next summer, </p>

  August 21, 2005:</b></u></font><p>Last night for a glimmer of a second, I witnessed an Old Iron City Spirit. 
  After two days of rainfall and overcast skies, a hole in the clouds revealed a golden sunset hovering above the glass bay. Out in 
  the water a single Boston Whaler floated in repose as two men fished. The rest of camp was still as the bay. Somehow seeing this 
  sight rendered my emotions satisfied and at peace. Indeed, all is quiet on the Northern Front. The dining hall has four tables and 
  the staff has four waiters. Iron City is peaceful and has reverted into seemingly simpler times, and yet somehow camp remains 
  absolutely fun and spontaneous. </p>
  <p>Saturday Night, we made the executive decision that a traditional Saturday Night Party would not do with the amount of people 
  in camp. Therefore, a movie night was in order. But this was no ordinary movie night; this turned out to be a movie and a show. 
  Earlier that day, Aubrey Phillips imparted upon Andy and me an old trick of wait staff past. Neither of us had ever heard of this 
  trick before, and upon its explanation we were dumbfounded because we did not understand. Needless to say, the trick involved 
  peanut butter, a lit match, a glass, and a lesson in chemistry and physics. Soon we understood the nature of this practice and we 
  all decided it would be best to demonstrate this trick before the movie. So Ben Johnson and John Bennett became subject to its 
  strange effects. To leave you in a slightly baffled state, I will not explain the trick at this time. It is better to see it than 
  hear it explained. Let&#8217;s just say it was slightly sticky (in more than one way). Now that I have thoroughly confused you, I will 
  move on! After the trick we watched the contemporary classic of 1982, the movie that should have won best picture over &#8216;Ghandi&#8217; 
  but it did not, the story that touched the world, the one, the only &#8220;E.T. the Extraterrestrial;&#8221; a fabulous film that still 
  resonates with the generations of today. We also were so lucky to have running commentary and witticisms throughout the film by 
  Josh Martin, and Jack Phillips. We all took comfort from this film after having said so many goodbyes. It is refreshing to know 
  that ET will be &#8216;right here&#8217; (pointing to his heart). Hopefully our departed friends and family will, like ET, be &#8216;right here&#8217; (in 
  our hearts). After the film we all headed home, each going our separate ways to greet the evening as we would. </p>
  <p>Sunday, from a staff perspective, proved to be one of the greatest Sundays ever! It was a beautiful day, a bit windy, but 
  beautiful nonetheless. The last Golfing tournament of the season had a moderate show of golfing duos, and yet each of these pairs 
  proved to be excellent golfers and handicaps never felt better. Even Gary Gregoire showed his skill on the putting tournament this 
  morning, garnering himself a 2 handicap! My oh my! Sunday afternoon proved to be fruitful as well. The staff won the softball 
  game, a striking infinity to zero. In fact, the campers did so poorly you might even say there were none of them on the field. You 
  also might say that the staff did not show up on the field either, and just assumed that we won - Infinity to zero. Dinner was 
  crazy too! As we sat down we all could see storm clouds rolling in. The only new arrival in camp that evening was the return of 
  Zorro Junior. By mid meal, the storm had arrived and it released its waters upon us. We announced vespers would be held tonight at 
  8:15. The campers then decided that due to the stormy weather, we should have vespers right after dessert in the Dining Hall. 
  Dessert came about and the storm cleared up revealing a sun beginning to set in the distant horizon. Despite this, Vespers was 
  still in the Dining Hall. We named it Coffee Time Vespers. The service was mainly an improvisation. Ben Johnson talked of how 
  sometimes the greatest Vespers one can have is in watching and pondering over the setting sun. Afterwards we sang &#8220;Day is Dying in 
  the West&#8221; and called it a service. It was perhaps the shortest Vespers service of all time, lasting maybe five minutes. After 
  this, a strange miracle occurred. Most of the staff retreated to the back room to shoot the breeze a moment, and upon returning 
  had discovered the campers clearing their own plates! It was as if they instinctually knew we had won the softball game infinity 
  to zero. Really, their explanation was they expected we had left to go sun set cruising. Taking that as a cue, the whole staff 
  headed off on Andy Douglass&#8217; boat, into the open and watched the sun set. It should be noted that this expedition to the open was 
  not well thought out, being a very windy evening, the swells were massive and we all got soaked. But this did not diminish the 
  beauty and power of that ever setting sun! Afterwards we returned to camp, and as a staff sat down in the lodge to watch the 
  office movie closet cult classic &#8220;Monster Squad,&#8221; a formidable film that transcends genre and sense. </p>
  <p>After this awe inspiring film, I was hit with a bolt of inspiration and decided to write this late night bilge. I realize it 
  likely will not be posted till the 22nd of August, but indeed it was written on the 21st. Anyways, it is getting on in the 
  evening, and so the computer and I must part ways. I hope all of you at home are well and having sweet dreams. We miss you much, 
  but nonetheless are still having a good time. Till next we all meet, cheerio! </p>

  <p>The camp is ever so quiet, but the ruminations of all our hearts and minds 
  beat to the pulsating rhythms of noise. </p>

  <p>Well, this has been a turbulent whirlwind of a week, flustered with 
  emotions, and action, and goodbyes as well as a fair amount of goofing off. I hope you will all excuse the tardiness of this 
  Bilge, because sometimes one must live through all the events of an era before it can be truly analyzed and written about. But 
  sometimes it&#8217;s also just a matter of procrastination. We&#8217;ll let you decide the origin of our tardiness. </p>
  <p>Today, we&#8217;ll get straight into the action, no meandering around. You all like to hear the word from Iron City, therefore we 
  shall give it to you. Give you word of the most high Paddle Dinner and the most rowdy Hootenanny and more. You shall know these 
  events as if you were there, and you shall live as a camper vicariously through this Bilge. With no further ado, we welcome you 
  into the portal that leads straight into the consciousness of a camp on Georgian Bay. Prepare your safety belts and be sure to 
  grip your parachute draw string, because we are about to enter a realm of peanut butter sandwich instruction and lengthy lion 
  hunts (sans bullets), so here we go! </p>
  <p>Wednesday evening Iron City welcomed back Bill &#8216;The Batboy&#8217; Scully to once again inspect our camp in relation to its flying 
  rodent population. That evening he gave to us a very special talk about those hairy winged critters that guard our night sky from 
  the treachery of blood sucking insects (the technical term for them is Bats I believe) and he was more than willing to give advice 
  and helpful hints to those who consider their cabins to have a bat problem. And for those who are interested, the Bats we have in 
  camp are mainly Little Brown Bats, a type of bat that is heavy in population density but relatively harmless to humans. According 
  to the Batboy, in the grand province of Ontario there are other nifty types of bats, such as the Big Brown Bat, and my favorite, 
  the Red Bat. The red bat is a fantastic specimen of the earth&#8217;s sample of living things. I have suggested that we raise dues to 
  include Red Bats into our budget, but I don&#8217;t think that will fly. </p>
  <p>Well, that rant about bats was nice, but the real zone of interest is probably the Paddle Dinner and Hootenanny. This year, the 
  tides of the red sea must have been strong or the wolves howled to the harvest moon in the right pattern, because the Paddle and 
  Hootenanny aligned to be on the same evening. With this knowledge in mind, everyone went to bed early on Wednesday night to 
  prepare for the action of the following evening. Thursday the 11th, day of the Paddle, was a beautiful, sunny day. It was as if 
  God spread the clouds to make it more clear who was to be the recipient of the great Iron City Paddle. The dinner, as usual was 
  elegant and filled with familiar faces and moods. All staff was appreciated, from the ranks of the kitchen, to maintenance, to the 
  wait staff. And in the end, one was graced with the award of Paddle, and for those of you who have not tapped into the Iron City 
  Grapevine, I shall now reveal the winner of the Paddle for the year of 2005: It was my brother and yours, Alex Johnson. After this 
  was announced, the usual brouhaha occurred, with many people inviting their friends to prematurely greet the bay. After the 
  brouhaha we had a hootenanny! What an evening it was for fun words! Hootenanny and Brouhaha! All we needed was a didgeridoo! But 
  there was no didgeridoo, only a fun and swinging Hootenanny, led by Nick Steffey and accompanied by the musical talents of Fred 
  Crawford, Sam and Jake Morrow, Alex and Will Scott, Ben Johnson, Mack Reed, and David Morrow; a motley crew of musicians who know 
  that music multiplied by free beer equates to a late evening of fun. The Old Friend&#8217;s Boathouse comes to life on that evening, 
  filled with warm light, friends, melodies. And on the wall, we were watched by a new painting of our old canine buddy, may he rest 
  in peace, Zorro Gregoire. If you have not seen this painting, you should. It&#8217;s quite touching and a good ode to faithful friends. 
  Well, the evening of the Paddle and Hootenanny stretched on into the late hours of Thursday night, and afterwards we all said 
  goodnight to the moon and headed on our ways. </p>
  <p>Saturday was once again a Saturday of fun. Meg and Sarah Schade and Biz Steffey hosted the party, the theme being Old Iron 
  City, and the games were all classic Saturday Night party games. It was also a pleasure to see a choir of bottle blowers tooting 
  out the tune of &#8216;Old Iron City&#8217; followed by a rousing revival of the Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich instruction seminar, with 
  Ben Johnson as the mouth and Andy Douglass as the arms. They were commended for creating a show that not only entertained the kids 
  with a mess, but also entertained the adults with wit. Sunday was yet another traditional Iron City Sunday, and in holding to 
  tradition, the staff lost the softball game with a typical score of 25 to 8. Vespers was hosted by Sue Ann Morrow and the rest of 
  her gang, and it was a very peaceful reflection on love accompanied by many appropriate readings and musical numbers. </p>
  <p>Well, its now Wednesday, and there is a week left of camp. Things are slowing down at a tremendous rate and much to our chagrin 
  we are losing our fellow staff members, or as we like to call them, friends. In this past week there has been much farewell 
  jumping in the bay, and many wet waves goodbye. This is a sad time to be on staff, and we are occasionally crying rivers, but we 
  build bridges over those rivers and get over it. We miss all of our fallen staff deeply and their empty rooms are a bit sad on the 
  eyes, and yet we move on into the bright new Iron City day knowing another summer is coming and we&#8217;ll be back with you (bum bum 
  bum bum bum bum). And so we work with pleasure here in the last few days of Iron City. We are sorry that many of you reading this 
  have left, and we miss you, but for those of you who are still coming, we await you with dedication and pleasure. </p>
  <p>Until next Bilge, peace out. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Love, </p>
  <p>Ben, Ali, Jason, Elisa, and Andy (The Fatigued Five) </p>

  August 8, 2005:</b></u></font><p>Iron City, a thriving metropolis pulsating to the unheard and yet ever 
  present rhythms of George Gershwin. Indeed, that is what Iron City has felt like in these past few very busy days. We are in the 
  throes of peak, and we are ever so carefully navigating its white rapids. Extra tables have been added to the dining hall, dinner 
  announcements has become a daily variety show, and little children run wild and aloof from dawn till dusk. Its quite fun. There 
  has been such a slue of activities this week and deciding where to begin is about as difficult as playing pick up sticks with a 
  rhinoceros. Nevertheless we must start somewhere, so we shall begin with the events of this past Wednesdays and move 
  chronologically forward. </p>
  <p>This Wednesday was the day of a great moment in Iron City Tennis history. It was the Staff and kid doubles tournament. All last 
  week many little tykes paired themselves with whom they deemed a powerful waiter in order to become triumphant in the match. But 
  of course, only one team would truly prove triumphant, and that privilege was given to Dusty Martin and Dan Modic &#8211; a team of 
  little men with big hearts. The following day, Thursday, was a very important day for the survival and perpetuation of our dear 
  club; it was the day of the finance meeting, the board of directors meeting, and last but not least, your favorite meeting and 
  mine, the semi-annual meeting. The contents of this meeting have not been disclosed to the office staff, but that information 
  could easily be obtained through probably asking any of the members. &gt;From what has been rumored though, it was a good meeting, 
  lasting only an hour and eight minutes if my sources are correct. The meeting was also hosted in the brand new dining hall, as it 
  was more meaningful and temperature friendly than the lodge. </p>
  <p>On Friday, another annual Iron City tradition took hold, and this of course was the Todd Cup. For those of you who are not 
  familiar with the Todd Cup, it is the fishing tournament in which you get all the big ones out of the bay and into your bellies. 
  The prize goes to the one who brings in the heaviest stringer of small mouth bass, but really, the prize goes to whoever sits 
  around the winner at the next day&#8217;s lunch. And for those who do not know or have not tasted, the fish in the dining hall this year 
  has been exquisite. The nutrients of our lovely Georgian Bay must be making those fish plump and lively. Ahh yes, you must be 
  wondering who actually did win the Todd Cup this year. Well, I&#8217;ll tell you. It was Paul Jenkins. His fish weighed an impressive 3 
  pounds 14 ounces. He is now a multi-Todd Cup winner and a terrifying legend to the small mouth bass. But of course, to many of 
  those small mouth bass, legend will become reality as Paul Jenkins continues to reel in the big ones. </p>
  <p>Now in regards to Saturday, a wise man once said &#8220;If the world were clear, art would not exist.&#8221; Well art most definitely 
  existed this past Saturday, and many people were perhaps thankful that the world is not clear. Indeed, Saturday was Iron City&#8217;s 
  art day, that day in which three artists, a potter, a carver, and a painter, come to camp and we get to come and gaze and touch 
  and buy! Many campers that day left the lodge with prizes a bit heftier than the Saturday Night party prizes one usually gets from 
  the lodge. And twenty five percent of the artist&#8217;s proceeds went to the Iron City Charitable Trust fund! So Bravo Artists! Keep 
  the world unclear and keep the art coming! Saturday was also the day of the famed among famous tennis tournaments at Iron City. It 
  was the Tolly Cup, and many tennis warriors donned their sharpest armor and swiftest rackets to be the champions of the hallowed 
  Cup. Through much toil and bravery, it was the team of Duncan Anderson and Sharon Chapple who eventually carved their way into the 
  heart of that cup. So once again, we must give a Bravo: Bravo Tennis Warriors! Saturday night of course brought about the Saturday 
  Night Party, hosted by Devon Sawin, Darcy Williams, and Lindsay Williams. The theme was &#8216;gone fishing&#8217; and this certainly made up 
  a slow day fishing because of the busy day in camp. </p>
  <p>Sunday, Glorious Sunday!! No one is quite sure how this happened, given this is peak week, but it must have been a cold day in 
  Satan&#8217;s domain or the planets must have been aligned because somehow the Staff won the softball game. Sure, you might here from 
  the camper team that our batting order was a little bit skewed or that one person hitting two consecutive homeruns is a little bit 
  conspicuous, or that the harmonica player was a distraction, but you know what, the staff got skill. That&#8217;s all there is to it. 
  Perhaps the campers&#8217; complaints are founded, but softball is not a sport of rationalizing or morality, it&#8217;s a game about winning. 
  So that evening despite alumni waiters serving dinner, the campers cleared their plates and once again caused disarray in the dish 
  room. Now backtracking a little bit, before Sunday dinner, we also took a second camp photo and rededicated the dining hall, which 
  now has a beautiful plaque signifying its construction in the year of our lord 2005. That evening Vespers was hosted by Rik 
  Rodefer, Lindsay Scott, and Rob Scott. It was a very nice vespers with a very nice choral number by many of the gentlemen campers 
  and Devon Sawin. </p>
  <p>Well, that&#8217;s about it for now. It&#8217;s been quite the eventful week up here in the great North of earth. It seems like the only 
  thing we were missing here this week was a bull fight. Anyways, it&#8217;s been a grand old time and if you&#8217;re not here you are missing 
  out. Keep in mind, in concern to peak we still have another week, but it is not for the meek. Till next our paths cross! </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Sincerely, </p>
  <p>Ben, Ali, Jason, Andy, and Elisa </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Ps. an interesting story came to my attention moments ago. Jack Huber apparently caught a 20 pound Musky just beyond Pikes Peak 
  this morning, but let it go as it was only 40 inches and fishing law states they must be 54 inches to bring in. So kudos to Jack 
  for proving that Georgian Bay&#8217;s scariest fish is still in the waters&#8230;and closer than we think. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<font size="4"><u><b> August 1, 2005:</b></u></font><p>A dark night fell upon 
	that camp we all hold dear on Georgian Bay. But it wasn&#8217;t dark in the 
	figurative sense; it was more the literal sense, because the power went out 
	all night long. We were all seated in the dining hall, enjoying friends of 
	old and of new, and suddenly as if we were a 1950s murder mystery, the 
	dining hall went dark. The darkness was consistently interrupted by attempts 
	from the Generator to get the power rolling and this of course, had a strobe 
	light effect on the dining hall which led many people to suggest we should 
	have a dance party. Eventually though, the generator took hold and the 
	dining hall was lit once more, as were the waiter cabins, and the office. As 
	for the rest of camp, well, there were many candlelit card games last night. 
	Though if card games did not suit you, the skies provided brilliant 
	entertainment with the first really good lightning storm of the season. 
	There was a wonderful buffet of lightning: some casual light up the whole 
	sky lightning, some traditional single bolt lightning, some flamboyant 
	spider web lighting, and once in a while there was a light up the whole sky 
	while a single bolt reaches to earth as spider webs cross the sky lightning. 
	It was good watching. But was this storm the reason our power went out? We 
	may never know. But I&#8217;d say yes. And for those of you still wondering, as I 
	write this bilge, the power continues to be out past the Scott Cabin on 
	Rattlesnake row. Thankfully many cabins near the dining hall have 
	volunteered their bathrooms for the use of those who do not have power and 
	should not flush their toilets. You know, the great truth we have all 
	learned from the past 18 hours is that nothing bonds a group of people 
	together like talking by candlelight and sharing each others&#8217; bathrooms. </p>
	<p>In other news, we once again were participants in a very busy weekend. 
	There was a rousing mixed doubles tennis tournament this past Saturday 
	morning. According to eye witnesses, Bennett and Sharon Chapple valiantly 
	used their rackets with the grace of a blind swordsman to become the victors 
	of this tournament. But of course, this was just one tournament of many. Who 
	will win this Wednesday&#8217;s kids-staff tournament, and who will be victorious 
	at the climax of all Iron City Tennis Tournaments, The Tolley Cup, this 
	Saturday? There are a lot of people in camp right now, and any of them could 
	be the chosen one. The Saturday Night party was hosted by the Boaks, with 
	the ever wondrous theme of &#8216;crazy pants.&#8217; This was an evening of trying to 
	outdo your fellow man by wearing pants that exceeded the wildness of all 
	other pants (in this context of course, pants is a relative term). Many 
	people sought the title of wildest pants, such as Alexis Rodefer and the 
	Gorilla Man (a certain Nick Steffey), but in the end it was the reigning 
	crazy pants king of last year, Don Sillers, who once again, was elected into 
	office. </p>
	<p>Waking up on Sunday morning, one could tell that it was going to be an 
	iffy weather day. Nevertheless, morning activities went on, and morning golf 
	was quite the popular event, despite being the second week where it has 
	rained during the middle of the tournament. Thankfully though, the morning 
	rain cleared up in time for the soft ball game, which lasted nearly two 
	hours long. It was a big and hard game, with perhaps more runs than the rest 
	of the summer combined. The final score, if memory serves correctly, was 13 
	to 10. Now, this might not sound impressive to those who don&#8217;t play Sunday 
	softball, but the fact that the staff somehow managed to get 10 points is 
	incredible. One might even go so far as to say we gave the campers a decent 
	challenge yesterday. And then of course at dinner, the power went out, but 
	you already know that. After dinner we had a nice candle and flashlight lit 
	vespers hosted by the Gallehers and afterwards, everyone went their own ways 
	to enjoy a solemn evening of powerless, phoneless and internetless Iron 
	City. Last night in some ways was like looking through a time portal into 
	the realm of Iron City of Old. </p>
	<p>Well folks, camp is filling up. But rumor has it, there&#8217;s still room for 
	people to come on up and enjoy the view! See you soon! </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Fondly, </p>

	Scott Creighton emerged victorious in the art of conserving and yet catching 
	fishes this past Wednesday. Soon his name will be engraved on a metal plate 
	and join the ranks of George Stronach, Rip Collins, Reece Jenkins, and 
	Lucille Rahn on the Collins cup. His fish weighed 3 pounds 4 ounces, beating 
	the fish of George (his father in-law) Stronach by merely one ounce. But 
	perhaps even more impressive and more sizely than these fish was a story 
	brought in by Marten and Gail Jenkins. In the dining hall that evening, 
	after the winner of the Collins cup had been announced, Marten Jenkins was 
	called to the microphone to relay one very big fish story. During their 
	fishing exploits, the Jenkins reeled in a 5 pound bass, but amidst all the 
	tumult of weighing the fish, unhooking it, and the likes, the fish made a 
	great escape that would give Steve McQueen a run for his money: It jumped 
	out of the boat, and got away. I&#8217;m sure it was a sad fishing expedition for 
	the Jenkins, but for all fishermen this fish should be a beacon of hope, for 
	this fish is alive and at large, perhaps waiting for the day it will meet 
	its final friend - Chef Bill&#8217;s frying pan. </p>
	<p>Also on the radar this week, a smaller and yet in some ways, a larger 
	fishing competition took place. It was the Crispy Crunch fishing tournament 
	for all those children who aspire to someday win the Collins or Todd Cup. 
	I&#8217;m sure that Scott Creighton at the ripe age of nine would have been a shoe 
	in at this competition. The goal, of course is simple: catch as many fish as 
	you can off the main dock. And in the end, if you caught one fish, two fish, 
	a red fish or a blue fish, you receive a Crispy Crunch. Even those that 
	showed up for moral support or to lend a hand, in the end, received that 
	hallowed of all Canadian candy bars. In total, there were 54 fish caught, 
	quite a formidable number for 14 fishers and helpers. And really, even the 
	fish were winners. All of them, be they rock bass, sun fish, or small mouth, 
	were thrown back into the water, free to live another day. And really, isn&#8217;t 
	having your life given back to you a far greater Crispy Crunch? </p>
	<p>This Saturday the Abramsons hosted the Saturday Night Party, the theme 
	was beach party, and everyone showed up attire that ranged from dorky, to 
	suave, to downright weird. The highlight of the party was the pass the 
	fishing rod elimination dance, a dance that in recent days has been 
	overshadowed by the Call out an activity elimination dance. It was a fun 
	party for all, and many were sad that by the time it was through the sun was 
	nearly set, and we could not flaunt our beach wear on the beach. </p>
	<p>Sunday was a drizzly grey day, but nevertheless all activities went on. 
	The putt putt match was greeted with a slight rain midway through, but the 
	Golfers are the real troopers at ICFC, and they persevered through the rain. 
	The softball tournament was also on the agenda yesterday and campers came 
	and sort of won. But as usual the staff did put up a valiant attempt which 
	was comparable to David fighting Goliath without a slingshot. You can always 
	tell that it&#8217;s getting towards peak when the campers start hitting balls 
	into the tennis courts and of course we had a few of those yesterday. 
	Vespers was once again hosted by the Staff, and Graham Puleo delivered a 
	very thoughtful homily on being shaped by your environment. It was a very 
	nice service, which oddly enough, had a wonderful amount of applause after 
	hymns and readings. </p>
	<p>Well, that&#8217;s about it for now, but I&#8217;m sure more news will pop up soon. 
	Thanks for tuning in! </p>

	July</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 20, 2005:</b></u></font><p>
	There was not a cloud in the sky as the sun rose calmly over Georgian Bay 
	this morning, waking two of earth&#8217;s oldest rivals: fish and man. The fish 
	awoke from their aquatic slumber only to then seek refuge in nearby seaweed 
	or rock crevices for they know that today the fishermen of Iron City will be 
	out in full force, flaunting hooks and worms. The fish know if they are weak 
	and give into the sweet temptation of a night crawler it would certainly 
	spell out doom. But fortunately for the fish, most of them are going to get 
	thrown back today! Indeed today, Wednesday the 20th of July is the 10th 
	anniversary of the annual Thomas Collins Conservation Cup! For those who 
	aren&#8217;t sure of what the Collins cup is, it is Iron City&#8217;s annual fish 
	competition in which the fisherman or woman is only allowed to bring in one 
	bass of 12 inches or longer. Some fishermen choose to keep and eat their 
	fish, but many others, in the spirit of conservation, will release their 
	fish after weighing it. This morning the Iron City fishers have been heading 
	out in droves, one of course will come back with the big fish, and many more 
	will come back with big stories. Who will be the winner? Well, you&#8217;ll just 
	have to keep reading our humble bilge. </p>
	<p>In other news, Iron City had a fun weekend this past one (but in all 
	fairness, when do we not have a fun weekend?). The Sloan&#8217;s hosted the 
	Saturday Night Party, and I&#8217;ll tell you, the party never sounded so good. 
	They used a brand new, transportable sound system which made the somewhat 
	goofy acoustics of the lodge irrelevant. The theme for the party was 
	Survivor, and people swarmed the lodge dressed in war paint, fishing nets, 
	and bed sheets. Even Gilligan and Skipper made an appearance, believing 
	themselves to be survivors, though if you&#8217;ve ever seen Gilligan&#8217;s Island, 
	you know they&#8217;re doing a bit better than just surviving. </p>
	<p>The following morning, we welcomed a modest rain storm into camp for some 
	well needed watering. Unfortunately though, the rain caused both putting and 
	soft ball to be cancelled, but we look ahead to next week for sunny skies 
	and high handicaps. That evening vespers was a short and sweet meditation on 
	the wonders of Night Time. By this point on Sunday the rain was long gone, 
	the humidity was back, and everyone was happy to have a quick and yet 
	meaningful vesper service. </p>
	<p>If there was one object in Iron City I would not want to be this week, it 
	would have been the fish scale, because it got quite the work out this week. 
	George Stronach and Clive Runnells brought in several stringers that 
	prompted people to choose carefully who they sat next to at the following 
	lunch. The fish will be thankful that today is the Collins cup and most will 
	be freed, because after the fisher warriors of this week, our marine friends 
	need a break. </p>
	<p>Well, that&#8217;s about it for now. We can&#8217;t wait to see your smiling faces. 
	And if you&#8217;re on the fence about whether to come up or not this year, here&#8217;s 
	something to persuade you: The sunsets have been really good. See you soon!

	<p>P.S. It has been brought to the Bilge Writer&#8217;s attention that on the July 
	5th Bilge, there was no mention of the Northern Lights Steel Drum Band 
	playing at camp. Due to this, I shall now write a recap bilge: </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Along with the American Flag Cake, the marshmallow roast, and fireworks, 
	we were graced with the musical talent of the Northern Lights Steel Drum 
	Band. This is the third time they have come to Iron City, and they are a 
	wonderful organization. Their music is fun and upbeat, often times resulting 
	in conga lines and just general dancing on the grass. On this particular 
	day, they came and played throughout the July 4th BBQ, and afterwards let 
	the campers have a go at their steel drums, which is always a fun highlight 
	of their visits. Afterwards they continued to play all afternoon to the 
	delight of everyone in the area and at the beach. This event was also a fund 
	raiser for the ICFC Charitable Trust Fund and many campers happily made 
	generous donations. So in conclusion, the Northern Lights are a real treat, 
	and they always set a wonderful and joyous mood. If you have not heard them 
	play, you are missing out! </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Excuse the lateness of this news, but I thought it important to mention 
	this as the Steel Drum band is most definitely Bilge worthy </p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>July</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 15, 2005:</b></u></font><p>There have been various reports 
  throughout this week that at times the water in the front bay has been nearly as warm as the air. Whether this is true or an 
  exaggeration is a matter of opinion, but a matter of sheer, unbridled fact is that it has been hot these past few days. One might 
  even go so far as to call it a scorcher. In retrospect though, this whole summer has been a bit of a scorcher, having seen only 
  two days of rain, and the rest of the days occupied by the unabashed sun. So if you&#8217;re looking for sunny times and beach dance 
  parties, ICFC is the place for you right now. But even if you&#8217;re looking for windy, rainy days, come on up, because we&#8217;re trying 
  to schedule a few for next week (I&#8217;m not sure the office wields such great power, but we&#8217;re trying here folks) </p>
  <p>This week Iron City hosted three scientists, who were in the Georgian Bay area to study and catch adolescent muskies. 
  Unfortunately these bright eyed biologists had about the same luck as most fisherman in catching that illusive fish. But even 
  though their quest for musky did not deliver, their stay was not unfruitful, as they delivered a nice talk about the habitat and 
  nature of that ever so scary fish on Georgian Bay. </p>
  <p>On Wednesday, amidst one of the days of blistering heat, our staff decided it needed a break from the dining hall, and we all 
  headed out to the shopping metropolis that is Parry Sound. It was a very pleasant trip all around. No one was lost, eaten by a 
  Musky, or left behind and we all came home with an abundance of t-shirts, moccasins, and the occasional cap gun. On our way home, 
  Moe Gregoire brought us on a slight detour to Spider Bay where several of our staff members, including the author of this Bilge, 
  jumped that deceptively high cliff for the very first time. In my experience, it did not hurt, but I did break my sandals. In a 
  way though, I&#8217;m thankful it broke my sandals, because when it comes to Spider Bay, it&#8217;s more exciting to come home with story of a 
  major back slap or a broken watch than to simply say &#8220;I jumped Spider Bay and it was fine.&#8221; And for those of you who are tempted 
  and seduced by Spider Bay but are still unsure of that fateful jump, I impart upon you wisdom that Ali Andrews imparted upon me 
  before I jumped: &#8220;Its fun.&#8221; And you know what, she was right (though if you had asked me midway through the jump I would have used 
  another adjective, like terrifying, or maybe regrettable). But as soon as you pop up from the water and realized you lived, that&#8217;s 
  when the fun really sinks in. </p>
  <p>Anyways, Camp continues to run smoothly and we anticipate your arrival with goodwill and good cocktail parties. Until then, 
  ciao! </p>
  <p></p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>July</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 11, 2005:</b></u></font><p>Well, so Ben Johnson didn&#8217;t win the ping 
  pong tournament. John Bennett was the one who walked away from the lodge in a harrowing chariot of victory. Though Stefan Modic 
  made a valiant effort, he ultimately could not compare to the unrivaled ping pong mastery of John Bennett. As the whole camp held 
  its breath, John Bennett swooped into a forceful victory over Ben Johnson, only to courageously defeat the likes of Daniel Modic 
  in the finals. In the end, his glory was manifested in a candy bar, courtesy of the camp, but in our minds, John has been branded 
  as a king among ping pong players. Other than that though, no real epic events have happened. </p>
  <p>This was yet again, a quiet, beautiful, and terribly amusing weekend. With Saturday, of course came the Saturday Night Party, 
  hosted by The Staff Leadership Team and Eleanor Bergland. The theme was crazy hats, a simple, and yet elegant theme. While 
  planning for this Saturday Night Party, we the leaders thought to ourselves that we should perhaps subject the adults to the 
  tyranny that is &#8216;Pass the hat.&#8217; After witnessing countless games of &#8216;Pass the Hat,&#8217; the Campers still could not live up to its 
  great expectations. Even with the aid of &#8216;Pass the Hat&#8217; veteran, Adam Boak, the campers still could not manage to win, and in the 
  end, it was Chef Bill who was victorious. Chef Bill has never played &#8216;Pass the Hat&#8217; before, and so one might pass this victory off 
  as beginners luck, but all who know and love &#8216;Pass the Hat&#8217; know it takes more than luck, it takes serious skill and 
  concentration. After that rousing game, Andy Douglass and Ben Johnson performed a new take on the classic two man Peanut Butter 
  and Jelly stunt. This time though, it was a lesson in hygiene. They explained how one goes about washing one&#8217;s face and brushing 
  one&#8217;s teeth with the proper equipment and messiness. As most good hygiene lessons go, they decided to do the actions of washing 
  the face and brushing the teeth twice. The first time went off without a hitch, as Ben&#8217;s face never looked cleaner and his teeth 
  never whiter. The second time though, for some unknown reason peanut butter and jelly were on the table, and thus Ben&#8217;s face was 
  washed with jelly and his teeth brushed with peanut butter. It of course, was an uproarious event with much laughter and many &#8216;oohs.&#8217; 
  Everyone left that party much amused and perhaps a little bit more hygiene conscious. </p>
  <p>Sunday hailed in a new age for the putting course, as par has been changed to 40 and a seven stroke maximum per hole has been 
  established. This year, the putt putt course is a deceptive playing ground, but it is not as hard as last year&#8217;s course. Many a 
  putter have been heroic and many have been frustrated on our humble green, which is a sign of an effective, but challenging putt 
  putt course. On Sunday afternoon, the traditional staff vs. camper&#8217;s softball game was scheduled, but unfortunately for the 
  members, only four players showed up, and thus the campers forfeited the game. But as usual the staff was up for anything, and 
  played two rousing innings of boy vs. girl soft ball, accompanied by the four campers. And Kudos to those campers who showed up, 
  you know who you areJ. Of course at dinner that evening, everybody suffered for the low attendance rate at the softball game, 
  having to put their dishes into the carts. So, a word to the wise for those of you coming up soon: show up at the softball games, 
  and be prepared for a fight, because the staff might almost win. </p>
  <p>Today, Iron City welcomes three Musky researchers who are being hosted by the Lawsons. They will be studying baby Muskies and 
  their habitats in Blackstone Harbor and near Moon River falls. Tomorrow night the three of them will be giving a talk in the lodge 
  about their research, and perhaps they will share a bit more information to us about Georgian Bay&#8217;s scariest fish. Well, that&#8217;s 
  all the news for now, but never fear, more news is always on the horizon. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <u><font size="4"><b>July</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 9, 2005:</b></u></font><p>All is quiet on the Canadian front. The 
  Grand Opening of the dining hall now seems to have faded away into the distant past, the Crawfords have migrated south and the 
  Staff is almost as numerous as the campers. We are all appreciating the calm and serene atmosphere of camp. The loons have never 
  sounded so beautiful and lonely, the stars have been glowing with brilliance each night, and the sun has been providing us with 
  comfortable warmth. </p>
  <p>This afternoon Alex Johnson, the athletic coordinator will be running a ping pong tournament, and as far as ping pong 
  tournaments go, this one promises to have some mighty competitions. Who will be the winner? Only time will tell (my bets are on 
  Ben Johnson). </p>
  <p>This is also shaping up to be the season of the whale. Many people big and small are making that holy pilgrimage of a swim to 
  Pike&#8217;s Peak and back, and in the end receiving the due reward of a candy bar and the title of whale level swimmer. Yesterday, if 
  my count is right there were four whales in our front bay, and in the past week there have been a plethora of sharks and whales. 
  Of course there have been a fair amount of minnows, pikes, bass, and muskies, but they just don&#8217;t seem to pose the same risks that 
  sharks and whales do. </p>
  <p>All in all, it is very peaceful and quiet here, with not a whole lot of action. But I think everyone would agree that there is 
  a certain wonderful appeal to having no action to flock to every moment, and instead letting the day drift on into the sunset. We 
  look forward to seeing you!<br>
  <br>
  Love, </p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>July</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 5, 2005:</b></u></font><p>July swept into camp last Friday in 
  gigantic bursts of wind. In fact, it was the windiest day in recent memory at Iron City. The front bay was filled with two foot 
  swells, and even the most daring of sailors decided they would rather enjoy a book on that day. People came into the dining hall 
  looking as if they had spent the afternoon joy riding in a 150 horse power Boston whaler, but we all knew that their windswept 
  looks simply were a result of walking for 10 seconds outside. On top of all this wind, it was Canada Day, that day of all days 
  when we commemorate the great country that hosts our club. And to celebrate we had a wonderfully sweet Canadian Flag cake for 
  dessert, and planned fireworks, but due to the immense wind, we decided it may not be the best idea to shoot flames into the 
  dramatic sky, and so postponed the fireworks for the next evening. </p>
  <p>Saturday night there was an amusing Saturday night party, held by the Branches. The theme was for all campers to dress up as 
  staff and all staff dress as campers. Needless to say, the Staff was not modest, and dressed themselves in appropriately goofy 
  camper attire. We were also graced with a wonderful lion hunt, led by Wendy Galleher and Chris Tadlock, with the assistance of 
  Chip Crawford, who made animal noises. Chip can do a wonderful monkey and elephant impersonation, but frankly, his giraffe needs 
  more practice. After the party was through and the sun was completely set, the fireworks began, courtesy of Matt McCarthy. From 
  Moby Dock, the fireworks blazed, and thankfully this evening there was no wind to blow them off course. After, everyone headed to 
  their designated cabins and slept soundly into the wee hours of Sunday morning only to wake up to another beautiful Georgian Bay 
  day, filled with putting, softball, relaxation, and of course, the Sunday nap. It should also be noted that many people were mash 
  potatoed at dinner, including the new doctor. I for one, am never going to get tired of the funny faces inspired by our dear old 
  mashed potatoes. Whoever thought of that tradition was a genius. </p>
  <p>Yesterday of course, was July 4th, and Iron City celebrated with a beautiful American Flag cake, and above it hung an arts and 
  crafts made American Flag (which, actually had 72 stars, but really, who&#8217;s counting?). Following dinner, there was a marshmallow 
  roast for the kids and of course, the usual marshmallow messiness ensued, and many children went home the happier for it. That 
  evening the Jenks, once again, complemented our skies with a magnificent fireworks show from across the bay. All around it was a 
  very nice July 4th, not too showy and still very thoughtful. So, in conclusion, Camp is running smoothly with generally good 
  weather, and we can not wait to see your shining faces back on the Canadian Shield. See you soon!</p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>July</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 1, 2005:</b></u></font></p><p>The dust has settled in camp after an 
  absolutely fabulous opening weekend. The weather was great, the food exceptional, and the activities all went off without a hitch. 
  Who ever would have thought opening weekend would be anywhere near 80 degrees, and we even beat that!<br>
  </p>
  <p>By the time we left yesterday, we had escaped to the open water for a little breeze on two occasions, the last of which was 
  Tuesday when my depth finder recorded a water temperature at Teddy's Rocks of 70 degrees! Amazing.<br>
  </p>
  <p>For those who didn't make it, please enjoy the included items to get a taste of what the grand celebration was like: 1) The 
  grand opening photo, 2) the blessing (which I might add left not a dry eye in the place, including mine, and 3) the champagne 
  toast to the new renovation. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Regarding the photo, a Crispy Crunch goes to the one who submits a correct head count! Be careful when you start counting - 
  there are a few heads you can barely see, and maybe one or two you have to imagine. <br>
  </p>
  <p>Keep checking the website - many events are now being scheduled, such as:<br>

  <p>Schedule change notice - we have moved the Paddle Dinner date in order that it can be held when most of our staff is still 
  present. It will be Thursday August 11th. <br>

  <p>Many people have taken home sun burns as 
  souvenirs from the past two days in Iron City. It has been extremely hot here, with temperatures resting at around 90 degrees 
  Fahrenheit and no wind. Over the bay there was a constant humid haze, and that haze called the peoples to the beach. The 
  trampoline has been getting a fair amount of use these days and many games of &#8216;King of the Floating Dock&#8217; have occurred (It is 
  still disputed who is the rightful king). Cabins, and club buildings have been quite hot, but fans and beverages have brought 
  relief to all. Surprisingly though, the new Dining Hall was relatively cool throughout this brief heat wave. In this writer&#8217;s 
  opinion, the last two days were tremendously fun in the heat, but alas all heat waves must come to an end, and today, Wednesday 
  the 29th, the weather is much cooler and overcast. And instead of being called to the beach today, it seems as if half the camp is 
  making a journey into Port Carling or Parry Sound to have their mid vacation civilization fix. </p>
  <p>Other than the heat causing much outdoor and bay activity, the camp has remained pretty quiet since last weekend. Many people 
  have left since Sunday making a smaller camp gathering, and giving momentary relief to our new staff. But we as leaders have made 
  sure that this moment of relief will not last long, for July 4th is in the near future, and by Jove, we&#8217;re going to make our staff 
  work hard once more! We are anticipating a good show from the Steel Drum Band this weekend, and we are anticipating good company 
  from the Crawford Reunion and many other familiar faces showing up to camp. But until this weekend comes, we are sitting back and 
  enjoying the simple pleasures of Iron City life, such as Bunko, which Renee Miller will be hosting this evening. And for those of 
  you who don&#8217;t know what Bunko is, well, you&#8217;re missing out. I&#8217;ll just say it involves dice and shouting and promises to be fun.
  </p>
  <p>In other simple pleasures news, a member of Gary&#8217;s maintenance staff, Jamie, caught a fox snake last night, a snake made 
  notorious for its modest impersonation of a rattle snake, and yet a very gentle creature. Many people petted it and held it, and 
  eventually it was freed into the wilderness from which it came. Also, this morning Anna Sillers and Alex Raley (Alex, the newest 
  member of our staff arriving just last night) organized a nice time of arts and crafts making popsicle stick frames that I&#8217;m sure 
  would do justice to any photograph it hosts. And in other news, as I&#8217;ve been writing this daily bilge, the overcast skies have 
  cleared up and the sun has popped out its head. Therefore I will finish this bilge, and go out to play! Good days to all! </p>

  <p><u><font size="4"><b><br>
  June</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 26, 2005:</b></u></font></p><p>The theme of this weekend seems to be 
  first. Yesterday was the first day in a long time that anyone can remember that the dining hall looked this good. With the help of 
  Helen Boak and Jack and Russell Huber, Saturday became a day to truly celebrate the new Dining Hall. Before dinner, the campers 
  all gathered for a cocktail party and group photo. While taking advantage of music from the new outdoor sound system, 
  approximately 120 campers enjoyed beverages served by the Sloan&#8217;s and hors d'oeuvres brought by their fellow campers. At 6:30 the 
  party moved inside where President Sloan gave a moving blessing to honor the Dining Hall, the Project, and perhaps most 
  importantly the camp and campers. A dinner of prime rib was then served followed by a champagne and lemonade toast in 
  commemorative dining hall glasses. The celebration concluded with a speech by Gary Johnson, the architect, and Jack Huber, the 
  chairman of the property committee, about the evolution of the dining hall project and about the dining hall itself. The two also 
  made sure to thank Jim Beatty, Florence, Gary and Moe Gregoire for the tireless efforts in assuring the dining hall project was a 
  success. </p>
  <p>The idea of first continued that evening with the first Saturday night party of the year. In keeping with the weekend&#8217;s theme 
  of tradition the McCarthy&#8217;s hosted a party which mirrored that of ICFC Saturday night parties of the past. According to Helen Boak 
  the ICFC parties of yester-year where held in the Dining Hall and focused on bringing the campers together in music and dance. 
  With this in mind the McCarthy&#8217;s asked Dick Boak, Nick Steffey, Alex Scott, and Will Scott to lead the campers in a couple of 
  songs while the band of four accompanied with their guitars. In addition Fred Crawford held down the beat with his wash bucket and 
  broom stick bass. </p>
  <p>Our third first of the weekend was the first softball game of the year. Campers won&#8230; </p>
  <p>Sunday night was the first time some of our beloved campers had waited a meal in decades. Chip Crawford headwaiter Sunday 
  dinner in blast from the past meal which found alumni waiters waiting on the campers. The meal was a lot of fun even though 
  someone forgot to ring the first bell. Sunday concluded with one more first as Robin Anderson lead vespers. </p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>June</b></font></u><font size="4"><u><b> 24, 2005:</b></u></font><p>It was a beautiful opening day for Iron 
  City, the climax of an all around beautiful week for the staff orientation. This week the wait staff, kitchen staff, and 
  leadership teams arrived at the beginning of the week and began training for what promises to be a wonderful and eventful season. 
  The staff camping trip, led by Will and Dave Scott, was an enormous success. The weather was good for camping, and even better, it 
  was good for staff morale. Ali Andrews amused us with some of the bad weather stories of last years camping trip, and it made us 
  more appreciative of this current camping trip. </p>
  <p>Chef Bill, Emile&#8217;s replacement for the summer, has been in camp all week as well. He is a very kind and likeable fellow, and he 
  promises to be a good replacement for Emile. His kitchen staff is another fantastic team we will have serving Iron City this 
  summer and they too are ready for fun and good cooking. Emile stayed with the Kitchen staff all week, making sure they have been 
  well prepared, and his presence was greatly appreciated by all. It is very sad Emile will not be joining us this summer, &#8220;but 
  another summer&#8217;s coming&#8230;&#8221; </p>
  <p>Opening evening went well too. The staff got the food out in good time, and people were generally happy with everything. The 
  new dining hall was met with much applause and Chef Bill had a very kind greeting by all. All in all it was a very pleasant
