		  When thinking about this summer, I wish that I could go back in time

		  in ship shape and it was great fun working along with Andrew in the 
		  office. I learned that making announcements in the Dining Hall is not 
		  the scariest thing in the world, and that a good attitude goes a long

		  It is a rainy day here in Iron City and the campers are resting and 
		  relaxing on their porches. This week has been a blur of activity and 
		  fun, so it is nice to have a couple days to unwind. On Tuesday, the 
		  week was kicked off by Gregg Scott&#8217;s birthday, in which the entire 
		  camp was invited to his cottage for a cocktail party. Reece Jenkins, 
		  Fred Crawford, and Bryan Phillips livened up the scene by previewing 
		  their musical talent on the Dining Hall porch. Music was in the air 
		  and everyone was excited for the Hootenanny!<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">After dinner, dusk fell and the merriment 
		  continued. Campers crowded into the Back Boathouse as the Savidge 
		  twins and Hannah Chapple welcomed the campers with their singing of 
		  &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; A highlight of the evening was the Salt Girls (Cary 
		  Douglass, Emily Bergland, and Eleanor Bergland) singing Jimmy 
		  Buffett&#8217;s &#8220;Margaritaville.&#8221; Led by our guitarist Chas Stewart, the 
		  Staff also sang the song, &#8220;Ho Hey,&#8221; for the camp. It was such a hit 
		  that we were requested to perform again at the Paddle Dinner! Overall, 
		  the Hootenanny was a huge success. Thanks to all who participated and 
		  made the night so memorable.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">And now for the moment we&#8217;ve all been waiting 
		  for&#8230;Paddle Dinner! The Arts and Crafts staff did an incredible job 
		  making decorations for our theme, &#8220;Under the Bay.&#8221; Molly Steffey lent 
		  us an enormous cloth backdrop of a bay landscape, which was stretched 
		  across the porch of the Dining Hall. Sparkling paper fishes weaved 
		  through green seaweed on the wall. After a tasty meal of stuffed pork 
		  loin and parmesan roasted tomatoes, staff introductions were made by 
		  the HR committees and our very own Headwaiter, Chas Stewart. Chas had 
		  campers rolling on the floor in laughter with his descriptions and 
		  quirky nicknames for the Wait Staff. Finally, the 2012 Paddle Winner 
		  was announced: Dusty Martin! Congratulations to Dusty for being a 
		  great waiter and helping us have the best summer possible.
		  <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">The camper numbers are going to drop dramatically 
		  by Saturday. Although it is sad that the summer is coming to a close, 
		  it&#8217;s been a great one.

  		  <font size="4">

  		  <span class="style3">August 6, 2012:</span></font><p>The power is 
		  finally back on and the camp is running smoothly once again! For 
		  almost two days, the campers braved the darkness of the cabins with 
		  oil lamps in hand. But with the help of our maintenance staff and 
		  coordination with Perry Sound, the power was on in less than 48 hours.&nbsp; 
		  Chef John was quite happy that the fridge was spared in this power 
		  blip. Don&#8217;t worry campers, we will still be serving Nanaimo bars. </p>
		  <p>In addition to the power turning back on, this past week has been 
		  pleasantly busy. Many campers were putting away on the green for The 
		  Sillers Putting Tournament. After a couple days of grueling matches, 
		  Andy Bennett came out on top as this year&#8217;s putting champion. We also 
		  had another very successful Adult Dinner with an incredible buffet 
		  spread in the Dining Hall. Chef treated us to a gourmet meal, which 
		  included mushroom stuffed chicken and succulent pork loin. After 
		  working the dining hall, I was lucky to get a taste myself. </p>
		  <p>Since 1985, a member of the Todd family has not won claimed the 
		  title of the Todd Cup winner. Unfortunately, that fact remains the 
		  same. Don Lawson out-fished the entire camp by catching a whopping 10 
		  pounds of fish. He said that it was the best fishing day of his life! 
		  Although my uncle Kerry Todd was banking on his three pounder to pull 
		  through, we were all ecstatic about Don&#8217;s success. </p>
		  <p>Tonight is the night of the Hootenanny and everyone is prepping for 
		  the sing-a-long. The wait staff is popping popcorn and sweeping the 
		  floors. The summer has been a success so far, and we have high 
		  expectations for the camper days to come. </p>
		  <p>Your Coordinator,<br>Elsie Widing&nbsp;</p>

  		  <font size="4">

  		  <span class="style3">July 30, 2012:</span></font><p>Hello Campers! It 
		  is another glorious day here on the bay. The breeze is warm and 
		  welcoming as it rolls across the water. The players in the Tolley 
		  Tennis Tournament were especially thankful for the occasional gust of 
		  wind as they hit their volleys and serves. Andrew and I even took a 
		  break from paperwork and represented the Iron City office on the 
		  courts. Although neither of us made it to the next round, I think we 
		  made Mr. Beatty proud. <br>&nbsp;<br>This Saturday, we celebrated the 
		  opening of the 2012 Olympics with a bang! The campers were divided 
		  into their country teams and dressed in their national colors. Festive 
		  banners and flags lined the Dining Hall while people poured in for 
		  dinner. To top off all this national pride, our First Cook, Kaila 
		  Saunders, made a fantastic Olympic cake with sparklers and all. <br>&nbsp;<br>
		  The fun continued with the Saturday Night Olympic Party hosted by Team 
		  Italy aka The Steffey Clan. A highlight was the Nick Steffey&#8217;s lion 
		  hunt. Because of the Olympics taking place in London, the campers were 
		  given the daunting task of finding Queen&#8217;s Royal Lion. The party came 
		  to a close with the awards ceremony. Our ICFC athletes did quite well! 
		  Many of our campers took home the gold.<br>&nbsp;<br>The one and only, Chas 
		  Stewart, conducted Vespers this Sunday. His talk centered on 
		  self-awareness and transcendence, especially focusing on the Universe 
		  as a whole. The campers loved it! It was something different and 
		  creative, and I am proud of my cousin for stepping up to the plate.<br>
		  &nbsp;<br>We still have the Sillers Putting Tournament and the Adult Dinner 
		  coming up this week. Not to mention the Art Sale in the Lodge. Peak 
		  has finally arrived! <br>&nbsp;<br>Your Coordinator,<br>Elsie Widing&nbsp;</p>

  		  <font size="4">

  		  <span class="style3">July 23, 2012:</span></font><p>Due to the small 
		  number of campers up here, this past week has been pleasantly 
		  relaxing. The weather continues to be perfect without a drop of rain 
		  in sight.&nbsp; Although there has been talk of drought, Moe and the 
		  flower girls, Kathryn Savidge and Hannah Chapple, have been making 
		  sure that the sprinklers are up and running.</p>
		  <p>This Tuesday, David Mills led the book discussion concerning the 
		  novel The Navigator of New York by the Canadian writer, Wayne 
		  Johnstone, While Lynn Edgerton may have been the only member in camp 
		  to have read it, the discussion was still very interesting.&nbsp; On 
		  Wednesday Barbara Boucek won the annual Tom Collins Conservation Cup 
		  with a whopping 3 lb. 3 oz. small mouth bass! The wait staff missed 
		  the fishing excitement because we went to Perry Sound that day. 
		  Instead of bringing back a bass from the bay, the staffers stocked up 
		  on candy and knick knacks. </p>
		  <p>We finished the week with a fun Sing-a-Long in the Lodge led by the 
		  famous guitarist, Chas Stewart. The Staff is looking forward to things 
		  picking up next week&#8230;we are going to have 126 campers on Saturday! 
		  With Peak approaching, the staff is ready to show off their fine tuned 
		  waiting skills in the Dining Hall. </p>
		  <p>Your Coordinator,<br>Elsie Widing&nbsp;</p>

  		  <font size="4">

  		  <span class="style3">July 13, 2012:</span></font><p>The day is winding 
		  down and chatter is traveling along the boardwalk. There is talk that 
		  the Modic&#8217;s Sunday Vespers was a great success! The campers were glad 
		  to see Claire, Jordan, and Stefan Modic contribute personal insight 
		  concerning the theme of introspection. When I talked to my Aunt Lynn 
		  Edgerton this evening, we agreed that one of Stefan&#8217;s points was quite 
		  memorable: &#8220;find something that you are proud of&#8230;enough so that you 
		  could tell a stranger.&#8221; Reflection is an important aspect of vespers, 
		  and I think the Modics hit that one home. <br>&nbsp;<br>Although the number 
		  of campers is declining at ICfC, we have been busy! With campers 
		  trying to squeeze in last minute picnics, the staff is eager to jump 
		  on board. On Wednesday, we had the annual Adult Dinner complete with 
		  cocktails and a delicious buffet, courtesy of Chef John Saunders. The 
		  menu included double stuffed potatoes, herb encrusted chicken, creamy 
		  fettucini, and chocolate-drizzled crepes for dessert. I had to taste 
		  some to see for myself. <br>&nbsp;<br>Because of the small number of 
		  campers this week, the Collins and Hugessen family hosted a Saturday 
		  Bingo Night in the Dining Hall! I was not on my Bingo game, but many 
		  campers went home with a candy bar in hand. Sunday was a monumental 
		  day for the staff&#8230;we finally won our first baseball game! Sad I know, 
		  but last year&#8217;s MVP, Dusty Martin, ominously states, &#8220;We will dominate 
		  the rest of the season.&nbsp; Be scared.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Tom Collins 
		  Conservation Cup is approaching and campers are grabbing their fishing 
		  rods. Looking forward to seeing you soon! <br>&nbsp;<br>Your Coordinator,<br>
		  Elsie Widing </p>

  		  <font size="4">

  		  <span class="style3">July 9, 2012:</span></font><p>It is hard to 
		  believe that it is already the third week of camp! Last week was a 
		  blur of fun as the campers battled it out in the Ping Pong Tournament, 
		  the Mixed Doubles Tennis Tournament, and the annual dice game, Bunko. 
		  Due to the infallible participation of the Patton and Sager clan, both 
		  tournaments went extremely well. Congratulations to Alex &#8220;Wildcard&#8221; 
		  Scott for winning the Ping Pong Tournament! He showed no mercy to the 
		  wait staff while he dominated both the ping and the pong with his 
		  sandpaper paddle. Stephen Firestone and Amy Patton showed Wimbledon 
		  potential on the tennis courts as they worked their way up the ladder. 
		  After a heated match, Stephen and Amy finally claimed first place 
		  followed by Chas &#8220;The Man&#8221; Stewart and Lilli Patton. </p>
		  <p>Bunko Night was a blast. Renee Miller enthusiasm was infectious as 
		  she led the epic event in the Dining Hall. We had a record number of 
		  campers show up: almost 90 people! One could say that the game is all 
		  luck, but I beg to differ. I seemed to have incredible skill at 
		  rolling dice the first round; however, I think fatigue kicked in by 
		  the third round as I was struggling to come up with a Bunko. Since the 
		  admission fee was one candy bar, many campers went home happy.</p>
		  <p>This 
		  Saturday, the wait staff hosted the Saturday Night &#8220;Pajama&#8221; Party. The 
		  campers dished out their nightgowns and slippers; not to mention Mike 
		  Winn sported a fantastic Canadian maple leaf frock. The games included 
		  musical pillows for the kids and the frozen t-shirt game for the 
		  teens. Maggie Schroeder, a nationally acclaimed Irish dancer, also 
		  performed a fast-paced jig for the campers. She was amazing with her 
		  fast feet and sparkly getup. </p>
		  <p>The weather cannot get any better up here on Georgian Bay and the 
		  campers are taking full advantage of it. The wait staff can be often 
		  spotted on the dock with the diligent lifeguard, Bridget Irish, on 
		  watch. After a busy yet eventful week with about a hundred people in 
		  camp, the wait staff is somewhat relieved to have a more relaxed 
		  schedule. We still have many more events planned, such as the Adult 
		  Dinner on Wednesday, so come and hang with us! </p>
		  <p>Your Coordinator,<br>Elsie</p>
		  <font size="4"><span class="style3">July 5, 2012:</span></font><p>It 
		  is the day after Independence Day and the staff is still reminiscing 
		  about the Bogart&#8217;s impressive firework show. After the staffers piled 
		  into the Iron City with lifejackets in hand, we started the journey to 
		  the Bogart&#8217;s island. When the staff finally arrived, the night was 
		  buzzing with mosquitoes and laughter. Bursts of fireworks reflected 
		  upon the water as we huddled together with root beer floats in hand. 
		  &nbsp;It was a truly memorable experience here in Georgian Bay. </p>
		  <p>This past week has been incredibly busy for both the campers and 
		  staffers. Congratulations to Todd Chapple for winning the Sunday 
		  Putting Tournament. If you win the putting tournament, Todd explained, 
		  you are allowed bragging rights for at least a week. We started the 
		  week off with the Martin&#8217;s staff activity: &#8220;extreme&#8221; tubing. Jack 
		  Phillips and I held on for dear life as Dusty Martin and Chas Stewart 
		  jumped like monkeys from tube to tube. Luckily, I have the entire 
		  summer to work on my tubing skills. After the weather cleared for 
		  Tuesday afternoon, the Chapple and Firestone Family graciously invited 
		  the Staff on a trip to O&#8217;Donnells Point. Apart from a couple days here 
		  and there, the weather here has been absolutely beautiful. If you are 
		  one of the four million people with no power this week, why not come 
		  up to Canada!</p>
		  <p>Because the Johnson Reunion is still going strong here at camp, the 
		  staff has dubbed this week &#8220;mini peak.&#8221; Instead of the standard Arts 
		  and Crafts, there was a Sand Castle Building contest for the kids on 
		  the beach&#8230;well the kids including Ben Johnson. Competition was high as 
		  the young campers built their motes and walls of sand. The campers 
		  received awards such as Most Original, Most Creative, Most Perfected, 
		  and Best Teamwork. Not to mention a sour key and the coveted Crispy 
		  Crunch bar. Overall, the day was a great success.</p>
		  <p>Upcoming events this week include a Ping Pong Tournament, Renee 
		  Miller&#8217;s annual Bunko in the Dining Hall, and a Mixed Doubles 
		  Tournament on Friday. Campers are looking forward to the Adult Dinner 
		  next week as well. Pack up your fishing gear and come visit us at 
		  camp!<br><br>Your Coordinator,<br>Elsie Widing&nbsp;</p>

  		  <span class="style3"><font size="4">June 30, 2012:</font></span><p>It 
		  is another beautiful weekend on Georgian Bay. The ICFC campers have 
		  been enjoying the Canadian waters as fishing boats and Ted Branch&#8217;s 
		  paddle board rip across the bay. Despite the large number of campers 
		  in the beginning of camp, the wait staff is doing exceptionally well 
		  in the dining hall. I have heard praise from Chef John Saunders and 
		  Souse Chef, Rosevelt Matthias, that the staff is attentive and 
		  ready-to-serve (despite the occasional baseball cap in the dining 
		  hall). Headwaiters, Chas Stewart and Annie Lawson, are working hard to 
		  insure that morning jobs and meals are running seamlessly. </p>
		  <p>With both Canada Day and July 4th approaching, the camp is teeming 
		  with excitement! Everyone was very impressed with George Stronach&#8217;s 
		  first catch of the season: a 4 Ib 8 oz bass. Following yesterday&#8217;s 
		  dinner, the birthdays of three staff members, Diehl Sillers, Helen 
		  Savidge and Kathryn Savidge, were announced with two impressive 
		  birthday cakes and a &#8220;dip&#8221; in the bay. After everyone dried off, the 
		  first evening games of Capture the Flag commenced. Younger campers, 
		  such as Oliver Chapple and Michael Hugessen, searched for the flag 
		  with the help of Wait Staff. The evening was capped off with a vibrant 
		  sunset and parlor games at the Siller&#8217;s cabin. </p>
		  <p>With many more arrivals today, the numbers of campers will soar to 
		  about a hundred people! Luckily, the Phillips are planning a great 
		  Saturday Night Party, which is based upon the popular movie and book 
		  series, The Hunger Games. We are expecting Brian Phillips to possibly 
		  show up with purple hair&#8230;I guess we will find out tonight! The Coyles 
		  are conducting Sunday Vespers with the accompaniment of Kathryn 
		  Savidge and Hanna Chapple as vocals and Chas Stewart on the guitar. It 
		  will surely be a weekend to remember!</p>
		  <p>Your Coordinator,<br>Elsie Widing &nbsp;</p>

  		  <span class="style3"><font size="4">June 27, 2012:</font></span><p>
		  Finally, camp has begun! The Wait Staff is waiting in anticipation for 
		  the first dinner of the summer. For the past couple days, both the 
		  &#8220;Funtastic&#8221; Four and the 2012 Wait Staff have been training non-stop 
		  for the big opening of ICFC. Jan Fougere, who is assisting dining hall 
		  training, has insured the forks and knives are in proper placement. 
		  Chef John has been cooking up a storm and is excited about new menu 
		  additions such as the fabulously decadent chocolate peanut butter 
		  cake. Make your reservations and be sure to bring your appetite!</p>
		  <p>We also are expecting a large amount of campers for the opening of 
		  camp and the 4th of July. The Johnson Family Party is having their 
		  bi-annual reunion this year, which will sky rocket the number of 
		  campers this week. The families arriving on main dock today will 
		  surely keep the waiters on their toes!</p>
		  <p>It is a cloudy today, but spirits are high. The Staff is ready to 
		  begin a successful, funtastic summer.</p>
