  		  <u>August 15 2011:</u></b><p class="MsoNormal">Greetings and 
		  salutations from the Georgian Bay!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Though camp is certainly winding down, we had a couple big 
		  to-dos recently. <o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Thursday was the annual Paddle Dinner, with all 
		  deserving fanfare and reverence to boot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The arts &amp; crafts chicks were meticulously slaving away over 
		  the decorations for weeks, and all their hard work showed that night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Fitting in with the theme of &#8220;Wild and Wonderful Wilderness,&#8221; 
		  we have Canada geese flying in formation on the ceiling of the dining 
		  hall, daddy-long-legs on the tables made from buttons and paperclips, 
		  and a few black bears hanging onto the sugar dispensers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Thank you also to the Commissary Committee and some very 
		  helpful ladies for arranging the lovely centerpieces and greenery on 
		  the tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A big thank 
		  you to DeAnn Sloan for putting together the programs for the dinner 
		  and thank you to Katie Sloan for putting together the fabulous name 
		  cards at the head table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  To anyone I have neglected to thank for your part in making Paddle 
		  Dinner so special: thank you, thank you, thank you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Once again, Chef John Saunders and his team 
		  provided a dining experience worthy of Paddle Dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>First, appetizers of crudités and onion sandwiches were served 
		  to the hungry campers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Next, the big guns came out in the form of roast pork tenderloin, 
		  stuffed with feta and spinach, served alongside roasted red potatoes 
		  and steamed asparagus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Que delicioso!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, 
		  dessert consisted of butter cream iced sponge cake with strawberry 
		  coulis and chocolate-dipped strawberries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We were swimming in desserts, as Brian Sloan generously donated 
		  the groom&#8217;s cake from his wedding in June, which was in the shape of 
		  the Iron City burgee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Although it was too pretty to eat, we consumed most of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Thanks to Chef John and the entire Sodexho staff for providing 
		  ICFC with good eats this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Maybe let&#8217;s try some bacon next summer?<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">As the evening progressed, we announced the 2011 
		  Paddle winner, but not before we introduced the rest of the wait 
		  staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been a 
		  wonderful summer working with these young adults, and Iron City 
		  couldn&#8217;t have asked for a more attentive and cohesive group of 
		  waiters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Congratulations 
		  on a job well done, and may the school year bring new challenges and 
		  experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hope you 
		  have all gained a new appreciation for Iron City and the people who 
		  love it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, the 
		  definition we used to choose this year&#8217;s Paddle winner:<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;The Paddle is awarded to that member of staff 
		  who best exemplifies the spirit of Iron City Fishing Club, in and 
		  outside of the dining hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>That spirit of Iron City is revealed in that staff member&#8217;s 
		  willingness to learn and listen, share and motivate, and respect and 
		  care about the people and environment that make up this community of 
		  friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kindness, 
		  cooperation, patience, and passion are the Paddle winner&#8217;s distinctive 
		  qualities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Excellence and 
		  hard work in the dining hall are essential, but success is expected in 
		  the many other facets that make up a staff member&#8217;s responsibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>This individual&#8217;s positive attitude provides for a productive, 
		  yet enjoyable working environment.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">With this in mind, we wracked our brains trying 
		  to find the right person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  The truth is that there were plenty of deserving candidates this 
		  summer, and the vote was tight right up until the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>In the end only one nominee received the most votes, and I am 
		  pleased to share that the 2011 Paddle winner is none other than Josh 
		  &#8220;Bearpaw&#8221; Martin!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am 
		  personally pleased (but not as pleased as Josh) with the results of 
		  the voting, so be sure to congratulate Josh and rest of the Martin 
		  family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Along with 
		  announcing Josh, we introduced the rest of staff ahead of that, and I 
		  will include these blurbs for the website.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">After such an exciting evening, the only thing 
		  that could have followed the next day was an Old Friends Night down at 
		  the back boathouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All 
		  the players were in place, and we strolled through the standards with 
		  ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A cast of thousands 
		  helped serenade the camp, with Bryan and Liza Phillips, Fred Crawford, 
		  Nick Steffey, David Morrow, and Jack Huber leading the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Thank you to all the featured performers, like Mark Groulx and 
		  Devon Sawin, who brought so much spirit to the evening.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Only a few more days left and camp is getting 
		  quiet, just as the weather broke from the heat of last week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Fred Crawford has been entertaining us on the piano daily as we 
		  walk in for meals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quiet 
		  camp is a different animal, and a friendly animal at that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I am sorry you can&#8217;t finish out the summer with the rest of us, 
		  but we&#8217;ll keep you in our thoughts.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Cheers,<o:p></o:p></p>

  		  <u><br>August 10 2011:</u></b><p class="MsoNormal">Peak has officially 
		  poked, and how!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We had 180 
		  members in the dining hall the other night, and we&#8217;ll be staying on 
		  that plateau for the rest of the week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>There&#8217;s some sort of &#8220;Paddle Dinner&#8221; on Thursday, but I should 
		  probably figure out what all that entails, and where I can find a 
		  paddle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">First, let me take you to the Sunday softball 
		  field; I have never been a part of a more riveting softball game, 
		  through and through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
		  campers took an early lead with a couple heavy bats and Mac Reed on 
		  the mound. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>By the end of the 
		  second inning, the staff were down 4-0 and feeling pretty glum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Next time up at bat, we got our mojo back and packed the bases 
		  with Zach up to bat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At 
		  this point I&#8217;d like to apologize to the tennis players on the far 
		  court, because this is when we started to ruin your game.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Zach sized up the first pitch he saw and belted a homer that 
		  one-hopped onto the back tennis court, 4 runs in, tie game.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Staff and campers went back and forth and we found ourselves 
		  behind 10-9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Though nearly 
		  incredulous by the fact that we still had a chance at victory in an 
		  August softball game, we kept our cool at bat and focused on the final 
		  half-inning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ben Sager up 
		  first: base hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Zach 
		  Martin up next: base hit, two on, no outs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Andrew Lawson, as if reenacting a scene from &#8220;The Natural,&#8221; 
		  nonchalantly walked to the plate and effortlessly swatted the ball to 
		  the back tennis courts, driving both men on base home and walking off 
		  to seal the victory!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Huzzah!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Great success!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Down goes Frazier!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Staff erupted and greeted Andrew at home plate with a joyous embrace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Though they lost, the campers didn&#8217;t seem too put out, 
		  considering the thrilling turn of events.
		  <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I told you we had a good team, 
		  but you didn&#8217;t want to believe it.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">The humidity was cranked up last week, but the 
		  bay feels as refreshing as it ever has.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>It is pretty humorous to see everyone simultaneously feel the 3 
		  o&#8217;clock heat and shuffle off to a dock or the beach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The really sweaty ones jump in and out, but the smart ones know 
		  to stay in the water.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Congratulations to Bobby Sillers, the winner of 
		  the 2011 Sillers Putting Tournment (merely a coincidence) and to Bob 
		  Boucek, the champion of this summer&#8217;s Todd Cup.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Along with those skilled gents, Rick Bergland and Alex Scott 
		  came away victorious in the Mary S. Scott Memorial Shuffleboard 
		  Tournament (another coincidence).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>It seems like every other day we&#8217;ve had an athletic contest of 
		  some sort, but folks are still finding plenty of time for fishing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>According to Chef John, he and Sous-chef Nigel Hughes have 
		  cleaned and served over 90 fish so far this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Hardly anyone has shared their catches with the Camp 
		  Coordinator, but they certainly look delicious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Keep bringing in the keepers, but let&#8217;s save some for next 
		  summer, too.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">We still have over a week left if you&#8217;d like to 
		  make the short jaunt across the border to enjoy the bay, we&#8217;d be happy 
		  to have you.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stay classy.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Cheers,<o:p></o:p></p>

		  <b>

  		  <u>August 3 2011:</u></b><p class="MsoNormal">Greetings one and all!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I write to you today from an ever-filling camp with peak right 
		  around the proverbial corner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We have a nearly-full dining hall, but plenty of room left for 
		  you stragglers who have yet to make the journey this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>It&#8217;s hard to believe that it&#8217;s already August, this is when we 
		  start running out of summer.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">This past weekend was filled with lots of 
		  activity, capping with the staff vs. campers softball game.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Since I have not been able to brag much about our prowess on 
		  the softball field, I shall use this space to do just that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The game began normally, but then all the pent-up frustration 
		  from losing earlier games unleashed itself in the form of a camper 
		  batting clinic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The staff 
		  was slapping softballs this way and that, often touching down on the 
		  back tennis courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
		  final tally was 14-1, staff victorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>To be fair, much of this had to do with poor camper turn-out, 
		  so it&#8217;s their own fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Of note, the one lone run was scored by Judy Sillers, rounding the 
		  bases in softball-approved flippy-floppys.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>That&#8217;s right campers, we&#8217;re on a 1 game win streak, flying high 
		  and taking all comers. <o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the campers decided to opt out of 
		  softball on Sunday in order to rest their arms for the Tolley Tennis 
		  Tournament on Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A 
		  variety of players signed up, and spectators lined the courts waiting 
		  for the final matchup.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
		  grand finale came down to the Duncan Anderson and Anne Stronach team 
		  facing off against the Lauren Musgrove and John Sillers squad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>An evenly-matched game if I&#8217;ve ever seen one, and fun to watch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>At the end of the day, the Musgrove-Sillers squad emerged 
		  victorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Congrats to 
		  the champs and all those who fought off the bugs in this year&#8217;s Tolley 
		  Tennis Tournament!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">The second Adult Dinner was held last night, with 
		  nearly everyone in camp enjoying the hors d&#8217;oeuvres and masterfully 
		  prepared meal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both of the 
		  dinners were great successes, so maybe we can do this again next 
		  summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank you to Chef 
		  John for the delicious food and thank you to the Commissary Committee 
		  for sprucing up the dining hall, a high-class dinner indeed!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Hope everyone is staying cool.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We&#8217;re currently sitting in a big downpour, and I couldn&#8217;t be 
		  happier: perfect weather for reading and relaxing.&nbsp;</p>

  		  <u>July 27 2011:</u></b><p class="MsoNormal">Dear readers: The heat 
		  and humidity has given way to a glorious breeze here on the bay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>In fact, this breeze would be better classified as furious 
		  gusts of wind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a 
		  shame we don&#8217;t have any sailors in camp, because these past few days 
		  have been absolutely perfect for sailing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We took the staff boys and girls out to Henry&#8217;s on Monday and 
		  Tuesday night, respectively, and had difficulty taming the open.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>But we&#8217;re tough folks, and we braved the waves in order to get 
		  to our destination of fried delights. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Thank 
		  you again to all those kind donors to the staff fund, we appreciate 
		  your generosity.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">This week&#8217;s Saturday Night Party was hosted by 
		  Todd and Kathy Chapple with a pirate theme in mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>After a staff game pie fiasco, we had to swab the deck (pirate 
		  reference) in order to continue with the party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Sunday Vespers was a staff-run event, featuring the musical 
		  styling of Jim Kinnear on the piano.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>After failing to come up an inspiring and profound message, I 
		  turned to Charlie Burke.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Earlier this year, Charlie delivered a sermon at a youth service at 
		  the Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Upon reading a transcript of said sermon, and gaining 
		  permission, I shared Charlie&#8217;s sermon with those gathered at Vespers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Even though my abilities as an orator pale in comparison to 
		  his, Charlie&#8217;s words and message shined through clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

		  <p class="MsoNormal">Lots and lots of events on the docket for the 
		  first week of August that you don&#8217;t want to miss: the Sillers Putting 
		  Tournament, the Tolley Tennis Tournament, the Semi-Annual Meeting, the

		  <p class="MsoNormal">Please come and visit, Chef John and his

  		  <u><br>July 21 2011:</u></b><p>Stop.&nbsp; Just stop right there.&nbsp; It 
		  is too hot and it is too humid to even think at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		  Our once-plentiful breeze from the bay has been replaced by the 
		  smoldering wall of heat.&nbsp; Satan himself called me in the office 
		  today, and he wants his weather back.&nbsp; Just yesterday the staff 
		  took our annual trip to Parry Sound, enjoyed a meal we didn&#8217;t have to 
		  serve, and baked in the sun.&nbsp; This is no complaint, mind you, 
		  just a simple observation that some kids came back to camp in liquid 
		  form.&nbsp; Once Moe returned us safe and sound, the staff made a 
		  beeline for the bay and stayed there.&nbsp; If I had my druthers, I 
		  would have moved my bed out to the floating dock so that I could 
		  submerge myself in the blissful relief the bay provides.&nbsp; 
		  Regardless, thank you to all who have donated so generously to the 
		  Staff FUNd (see what I did there).&nbsp; It was a great trip and we 
		  appreciate those kind campers by being really great waiters and by not 
		  screwing up a great number of breakfast orders.</p>
		  <p>The Collins Cup was held yesterday, with tremendous efforts by all 
		  who participated.&nbsp; The summer thus far has been great for 
		  fishing, and did not disappoint during a great fishing contest.&nbsp; 
		  It seemed that Bob Boucek was ready to engrave his name onto the cup 
		  when at the last moment, Marten Jenkins Jr. brought in a beautiful 
		  bass that sealed the day.&nbsp; Congratulations to the recipient of 
		  the 2011 Collins Cup and all who fished those glorious fish.</p>
		  <p>Following right on the heels of that major fishing tournament was 
		  today&#8217;s Crispy Crunch Fishing Contest.&nbsp; A great turnout by the 
		  14-and-under crowd at the back bay, and this crew caught almost as 
		  many fish as the big kids in the Collins Cup.&nbsp; Conservation was 
		  the name of the game, and our participants followed this tenet 
		  closely.&nbsp; Crawford Stricker, a born fisherman, reeled in a great 
		  bass that snagged him the Crispiest of all the Crunches.&nbsp; 
		  However, once the time allotted for the contest had elapsed, a few 
		  dedicated youngsters stayed put and cast out another line in the hopes 
		  of continuing their success. &nbsp;Michael Hugessen&#8217;s instincts paid off 
		  and in a big way, so congratulations to all these once and future 
		  fisherpeople. </p>
		  <p>You know, this edition of the Daily Bilge pretty much writes 
		  itself: Had enough with obscenely high temperatures?&nbsp; Come to the 
		  bay.&nbsp; Want to jump off of a dock?&nbsp; Come to the bay?&nbsp; 
		  Need more time to read?&nbsp; Come to the bay.&nbsp; Tired of going 
		  days without playing a single match of bocce?&nbsp; Come to the bay, 
		  plain and simple, done and done.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget to send me those 
		  reservations.&nbsp; August numbers are low at the moment, but you can 
		  fix that, right?&nbsp; Farewell for now, and stay cool until you join

  		  <u>July 18 2011:</u></b><p class="MsoNormal">Greetings, faithful 
		  readers!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I write to you 
		  now fresh from the Sunday softball game, shining and victorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The campers fielded a deep team this week, even bringing in a 
		  couple ringers, but the staff prevailed with solid fielding and 
		  tie-dyed shirts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a 
		  result, campers had to clear their own dishes this evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Be careful, dear campers, this might become a habit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Afterwards, the Collins and Bushkoff families led 
		  the camp in Vespers, dedicating the newly refinished lectern 
		  (beautifully done by Florence) in the memory of our late Anne Collins.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Though we miss her greatly, her presence will never be 
		  forgotten.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Keep the 
		  Collins family in your thoughts this summer.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">
		  <o:p>On the subject of Cathy Collins, she has been bringing in some 
		  great fish, including an 8 pound pickerel just the other day.&nbsp; Reece 
		  Jenkins is bringing in good fish as well, but they don&#8217;t really count 
		  until Wednesday the 20th when the Collins Cup is held.&nbsp; Grab some 
		  worms in the store, them fishies is hungry. </o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Gregg Scott has been an excellent camp counselor 
		  this summer!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Last week, he 
		  arranged for Wendy Cooper from the Georgian Bay Land Trust to come and 
		  lead us on a nature walk back by Twosers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Wendy dropped some knowledge about the bay area wetlands and 
		  some of the flora and fauna in our neck of the woods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The next day, Gregg held a viewing in the lodge of a dvd on the 
		  history of the Georgian Bay region, ranging from the movement of the 
		  First Nation through the territory to the colonization of Parry Sound 
		  by some guy named &#8220;Beatty.&#8221;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>It is quite a thorough history and I officially endorse this 
		  product as interesting and educational.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">The weather has been humid and just a little 
		  sticky, but makes the bay that much more refreshing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Camp is starting to fill in, and camper days are the goal, so 
		  make your reservations sooner rather than later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The Crawfords are doing their part for camper days with a 
		  family reunion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like my 
		  mother always told me, &#8220;camper days.&#8221;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>On a related note, camper days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Also: camper days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  See you soonsies, and congratulations to all of our Iron City 
		  marriages this summer (so far)!<o:p></o:p></p>

  		  <u><br>July 11 2011:</u></b><p class="MsoNormal">Greetings from the 
		  glorious Georgian Bay!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Scribing the first edition of the 2011 Daily Bilge is your Coordinator 
		  for the summer, Stewart Bennett.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>I am honored to again be in this position and I hope that I can 
		  provide a glimpse into the goings-on around camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Right off the bat, I apologize for the tardiness of this post, 
		  I will not make it a habit.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Firstly, thank you to Mr. Beatty and the 
		  Gregoires for putting in the time and effort that makes Iron City 
		  beautiful every summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		  Secondly, a special congratulations to Gary and Florence Gregoire as 
		  they celebrated their 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary this past Tuesday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Quite a milestone and we wish them many more years of 
		  happiness!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Welcome to the 130<sup>th</sup> encampment of the 
		  Iron City Fishing Club!<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">After a little over a week since camp opened on 
		  the 29<sup>th</sup>, the weather on the bay has been splendidly sunny 
		  and only a tad chilly at night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The afternoons have been a bit still, but all the more inviting 
		  for a dip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears we 
		  have some rain coming our way this week, but we&#8217;re probably due.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">We had busy past week, what with Canada Day, 
		  Independence Day, and the newest addition to your summer cruise, the 
		  Adult Dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 
		  Commissary Committee has planned, with Chef John Saunders&#8217; expertise, 
		  two delightful evenings filled with hors d&#8217;oeuvres in the Old Friends 
		  Boathouse, sophisticated conversation, and fine food.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>For only $10, you too can join us for our next Adult Dinner on 
		  August 2<sup>nd</sup>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our 
		  first of the two was held on July 5<sup>th</sup> and received high 
		  praise from those in attendance. <o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">The first Saturday Night Party of the year was 
		  hosted by the Strickers and the Weissbergs with a &#8220;Red and White and 
		  Red, White and Blue&#8221; theme.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Lots of smaller kids went home with more candy that night, so 
		  everybody wins.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next 
		  evening, the Johnsons led the camp in the inaugural Vespers of the 
		  season.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gary Johnson&#8217;s 
		  homily focused on the spiritual exploration by Thomas Jefferson, 
		  inspired by a recent trip to Monticello in Charlottesville.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">The weekly softball game got off to a rousing 
		  start with an early staff lead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Only an inning later, the campers mounted a series of offensive 
		  strikes, and never looked back. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Todd 
		  Chapple, Kyle Stricker, and Tim Alexander led the way for the campers 
		  with Bobby Reigeluth notching the save.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Beware the staff team this year, we&#8217;ve got an arsenal of bats 
		  ready and loaded.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">Speaking of the staff, I&#8217;ve already introduced 
		  myself as the Coordinator, but I&#8217;ve neglected to mention the other 
		  members of the Fab Four, otherwise known as The Superfriends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Megan Collins has returned as one of the Headwaiters, working 
		  alongside newcomer Zach Martin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>The final member of the Leadership Team is Andrew Lawson, the 
		  Bookkeeper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Please feel 
		  comfortable speaking with any of us at any point so that we may help 
		  you enjoy your time in camp this summer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>As for the Wait Staff, we have included photos of each staff 
		  member and a short bio on the ICFC website, so go take a gander.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>We have a pretty great bunch this summer, I hope you get to 
		  meet them all.<o:p></o:p></p>
		  <p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ll wrap this up with a reminder to call or 
		  email the office to make reservations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>It is important to get numbers for the kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Also, when talking to Florence about getting the cabin ready 
		  for arrival, please remember to make a reservation as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>Okeydokey, time for a swim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		  </span>See you on the bay!<o:p></o:p></p>
