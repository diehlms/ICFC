		  <p>Good Morning Iron City<br><br>We are in full gear now, numbers are 
		  hovering around 160 and we are on track to be over 200 by August 3rd, 
		  which also happens to be my birthday, not that I&#8217;m expecting gifts or 
		  personal donations. <br><br>I would first like to apologize for the 
		  delay in writing the Daily Bilge. Things have been crazy since my last 
		  post, and I have been feeling a severe case of writer&#8217;s block, as 
		  people know these Daily Bilges take a great deal of thought and 
		  eloquence. <br><br>The weather in the last week has been absolutely 
		  spectacular, with the exception of one day in which a torrential 
		  downpour took place. Coinciding with the great weather, Iron City has 
		  been host to some incredible events. The Hootenanny took place on the 
		  30th, with Dick Boak, Nick Steffey, Alex Scott, Reece Jenkins, Sam 
		  Morrow and special guest Moon River Mark bringing the house down. 
		  Hootenanny also fostered a new found love for auto-harp in many people 
		  as Dick Boak played a personal concert for the ages. <br><br>On the 
		  following day Iron City hosted its second art sale of the summer. It 
		  was a great event with almost a hundred guests from around the 
		  Archipelago taking time to visit. The sales totalled just under 
		  $22,000, with about $4,400 going towards the endowment fund. The 
		  following day (August 1st), was the semi annual meeting, where the 
		  camp honoured Jim Beatty with a beautiful painting for his 25 years of 
		  contributions to Iron City. <br><br>August 2nd was Todd Cup day with a 
		  vast field of competitors in the end however, George Stronach IV edged 
		  out George Stronach III and Dan Abramson. Friday was also host to a 
		  beautiful celebration of life for Lynne Brabant. Many stories of her 
		  resiliency and positive attitude in the face of adversity were told, 
		  and many friends and family flew in from around the world to attend. 
		  August 3rd, in addition to being my birthday was the final of the 
		  Sillers Cup Putting competition, referred to as the Texas Roadkill 
		  classic by the Sillers family. I edged out John Sillers in the end 
		  capturing ICFC&#8217;s most coveted prize, the Siller&#8217;s taxidermied 
		  armadillo. <br><br>On August 3rd the Bonnidy&#8217;s hosted the Saturday 
		  night party with special guests Claire Cunningham and Eleanor Burcham 
		  to teach members of ICFC how to make a proper PB&amp;J. The low net 
		  competition for the Sunday putting tournament was won by newly weds 
		  Thor and Abigail Mccarthy, while low gross was won by myself and Mr. 
		  Jim Kinnear. In the afternoon Nick Steffey brought in the current LA 
		  Dodgers roster to play the staff in softball, who promptly beat the 
		  staff 18-4. Sunday evening Chip Crawford hosted vespers, asking people 
		  to remember their earliest ICFC memory. He then talked about 
		  children's approach to play, and the lessons we can take from their 
		  actions as we become older. <br><br>On Monday, the Mary S. Scott 
		  shuffleboard tournament took place with the prohibitive favourites, 
		  myself and Eleanor Musgrove getting knocked out in stunning fashion. 
		  In the end Manny Parodi repeated as champion, however this time with 
		  the steely veteran Alex Scott. In the evening the Eleanor Bergland and 
		  Emily Scott rudely upstaged me and my announcements, reading a 
		  beautiful poem about their sister Brita who on the prior day got 
		  engaged to her now Fiance, Ben Allen. Later in the night the 
		  Stewarts/Widings hosted a Burt Todd story session in the lodge, 
		  recalling his eventful life. <br><br>I think that's pretty much it in 
		  terms of events, it's very possible I got the dates wrong, but I&#8217;m 
		  coordinator so go with it. Fishing has been very good in recent days, 
		  with many three pound bass being brought in. Also since the last bilge 
		  we have had two awesome staffers leave, Noah Mackey on August 2nd, and 
		  Oliver Chapple earlier this morning. We also have staffers leaving on 
		  August 9th, the day after paddle, so if you get the chance, please 
		  make sure to thank them for a great summer. <br><br>Numbers are slowly 
		  beginning to wind down, so just a reminder to get your reservations in 
		  whether it be offseason or the end of camp.&nbsp; <br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey<br></p>

		  <p>Hello Iron City<br><br>We are in full gear now, numbers are 
		  hovering around 160 and we are on track to be over 200 by August 3rd, 
		  which also happens to be my birthday, not that I&#8217;m expecting gifts or 
		  personal donations. <br><br>This past week was packed with events and 
		  activities. On Thursday the Chapples hosted the inaugural S'mores in 
		  the new fire pit. On Saturday in addition to the Brozeski&#8217;s &#8220;twinning&#8221; 
		  themed Saturday night party, the friends of the Massasauga Concert 
		  took place in the lodge, while rain poured down outside. At this 
		  event, ICFC members helped raise over $2,200 dollars which goes 
		  towards refurbishing wreck island, and other islands around the 
		  Archipelago. Also on Saturday the Tolley Cup took place, Frank Coyle 
		  declared himself before the tournament the prohibitive favourite, 
		  however when the time came to signup he had a severe case of dancer&#8217;s 
		  hip. The tournament however was postponed right before the finals as 
		  the weather turned for the worse, and it is still uncertain how the 
		  tournament will end. <br><br>On Sunday in addition to the staff 
		  winning softball in dramatic fashion, Stephen Firestone and Spencer 
		  Irish won the Low Net competition and Low Gross was taken by John 
		  Sillers. In the evening, Mary Ann Martin hosted one of the best 
		  Vespers in recent memory, taking lessons about pressure and flow from 
		  her sprinkler system and applying it to everyday life. Myself and many 
		  others were incredibly moved by the service, and I would just like to 
		  say thank you again to Mary Ann for sharing. <br><br>In other news, 
		  Inclement weather has also forced the date of the hootenanny to change 
		  from tonight (July 29th) to tomorrow (July 30th). Also coming up on 
		  July 31st is the art sale. My mom has described it as probably the 
		  biggest and most ambitious undertaking since the Toronto Raptors 
		  forged their way to the 2019 NBA championship. <br><br>Also on the 
		  horizon is the Festival of the Sound, we have two complimentary 
		  tickets for the dates July 30th, July 31st and August 8th. If that 
		  interests you or your family please let the office know! <br><br>In 
		  terms of fishing, things have picked up as Bass are being consistently 
		  brought in, and the kitchen is doing a fantastic job cooking them. 
		  Looking forward to seeing you all soon! <br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey<br></p>

		  <p>Hello Iron City<br><br>This weekend was host to an incredibly 
		  successful Saturday Night Party and Sunday Vespers. The party was 
		  headlined by a peanut butter and jelly demonstration by Dusty and Zach 
		  Martin, who showed the intricacies of making a perfect sandwich, and 
		  opened many peoples eyes in terms of the variety of toppings one can 
		  include. For Vespers my uncle Bruce Lawson talked about time, 
		  specifically how his life has changed since his car accident just over 
		  25 years ago. <br><br>On monday, the Scott&#8217;s hosted their world famous 
		  Christmas in July party, and while nobody formally voted, Frank Coyle 
		  and Richard Reed think I was the best dressed which is all the 
		  validation I need. <br><br>Yesterday, nearly half of camp made their 
		  way out to the Umbrellas for a spectacular picnic, though the usual 
		  landing spot is now underwater. <br><br>Ben Sager and Dusty Martin 
		  shot the course record on the ICFC green, combining for a low net best 
		  ball of 27 with no handicap. Bobby Reigeluth presented them with two 
		  signed golf balls for their efforts, they have since received offers 
		  upwards of three thousand dollars for the collectors item. <br><br>We 
		  have received new sizes in some of this summer&#8217;s hottest items, 
		  however, they are selling fast so make sure you bribe me to keep one 
		  set aside. Numbers are about to skyrocket so please be patient with 
		  your coordinator as he will try to write the daily bilge at regular 
		  intervals. Looking forward to seeing you all soon.&nbsp; <br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey<br></p>

		  <p>Hello Iron City<br><br>Things are starting to get interesting on 
		  the waters of the Archipelago. The adult dinner was a huge success, 
		  the kitchen prepared some absolutely scrumptious lobsters, served with 
		  a side of delightful asparagus and alluring potatoes. Frank Coyle said 
		  it was the best adult dinner in recent memory which is especially 
		  weird considering he didn&#8217;t attend the event this year. <br><br>On 
		  Wednesday the staff made their way to Parry Sound for a day of 
		  shopping and eating. Later that evening the girls embarked on their 
		  way to Henry&#8217;s, returning to an elaborate scavenger hunt to reclaim 
		  their belongings. On Thursday, the boys similarly went to Henry&#8217;s 
		  returning to a prank involving many frozen articles of clothing. Also 
		  on Thursday&nbsp; despite the stifling heat the Goodrich&#8217;s hosted the 
		  cocktail party of lifetime, starting promptly at 5:30 and ending at 
		  approximately 10:30 pm. This event once again outlined the 
		  perseverance of campers, who braved the elements to come together. <br>
		  <br>Last night David Fritz hosted a session on fishing topwater, while 
		  the staff enjoyed a pizza party. This morning, the ICFC staff lost a 
		  valuable member, the Waiter of the Week Noah Petrick left the staff 
		  for a family reunion. We will no doubt miss his contributions in the 
		  dining hall and his absurd stories. Tonight the saturday night party 
		  will be hosted by Jake and Joss Coyle, the theme being &#8220;Iron City 
		  Zoo&#8221;. <br><br>Other than that there is not much to update, the numbers 
		  are rising as we make our way towards peak and we are excited to have 
		  everyone arrive in the next few days.&nbsp;<br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey<br></p>

		  <p>Hello Iron City<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite numbers hovering around 40, campers 
		  managed to make the most of the last few days. The weekend was 
		  headlined by an electrifying Saturday night party hosted by the 
		  leadership team, showcasing our wide ranging talents and abilities.
		  <br><br>On Sunday, low net for putting was won by Cynnie Anderson&#8217;s 
		  and Jerry Rampelberg&#8217;s collective 32 while low gross was won by my 
		  father Jaime Hugessen with a 37. Sunday evening showcased Walter F. 
		  Jenkin&#8217;s vespers service about how unexpected events can bring you 
		  closer together and allow you to find a deeper love. We also had 
		  consecutive staff birthdays on Sunday and Monday, as both Jorie Brown 
		  and Jamie Huber turned 16. For Jorie however, turning 16 on Sunday was 
		  not enough.<br><br>Despite a breadth of competitors seeking to claim 
		  the Collins Cup with the largest bass of the day, Jorie laid waste to 
		  the entire field, edging out Rip Collins by one ounce, outlining just 
		  how dynamic this summer&#8217;s wait staff is. And while it may be a cold 
		  overcast day here in the Archipelago there is a palpable excitement 
		  around Camp. <br><br>The Adult Dinner, otherwise known as the premier 
		  event of the summer is mere hours away. Hundreds of bacon wrapped 
		  dates are currently being prepared in addition to lobster and chicken. 
		  Everyone who is reading this from anywhere but the Massasauga Park 
		  region should take a moment to reflect on why they weren&#8217;t here for 
		  this seminal event. <br><br>Speaking of seminal events, Gregg Scott 
		  has asked me to remind members of the friends of Massasauga Park 
		  Concert coming up on the 27th. Tickets or donations can be charged to 
		  your account and the money from this year&#8217;s event will go to restoring 
		  wreck island. Anyways, that is it from me, looking forward to seeing 
		  you all soon!<br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey</p>

		  <p>Good Morning Iron City,<br><br>The last few days at Iron City have 
		  been relatively uneventful. While In the immediate wake of the Kawhi 
		  Leonard news campers stayed strong, in the last few days people have 
		  been visibly dejected and upset. Today campers did their best to 
		  reverse this trend as a large contingent of campers including the 
		  Sloan's, Schroeder's, Branch&#8217;s braved their way through large rollers 
		  to take the staff out on a picnic. The Branch&#8217;s must be trying to get 
		  in the good graces of the coordinator as they also hosted a staff tye 
		  dye session. Please feel free to try to best them when you come up to 
		  camp. <br><br>Additionally, the absence of a piano player has lead to 
		  some incredible acapella performances by myself and guests, including 
		  a rousing performance of Oh Canada by Ted Branch, a stirring rendition 
		  of the This Place we Call Iron City by Wally Sloan and the crown 
		  jewel, a group effort by the Brian Sloan ensemble singing My Land. 
		  However if no one steps up to play the piano soon I will resort to 
		  cold calling campers to lead songs as I have very sensitive vocal 
		  cords. <br><br>In terms of fishing there was some controversy on 
		  Wednesday. Heath Boucek brought in what some people believe to be the 
		  first Tiger Muskie in the history of ICFC while others believe it to 
		  be a standard northern pike. Tiger Muskie are a cross breed of 
		  Northern Pike and Musky and they are very difficult to identify. 
		  Regardless, Heath&#8217;s 11 pound 14oz fish will likely be on the board. </p>
		  <p>
		  <img alt="Tiger Muskie" height="647" src="Images/2019/TigerMuskie.jpg" width="451"><br>
		  <br>Numbers are hovering around 60 at the moment and will get lower 
		  briefly before things pick up around July 25th.<br><br>That&#8217;s pretty 
		  much it from me, I&#8217;m sorry because that was probably the strangest 
		  instalment of the daily bilge yet, let's hope it only gets weirder 
		  from here on.&nbsp; <br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey</p>

		  <p>Note: If you are planning on being in camp July 16th and are 19+ 
		  please input your reservations and let us know if you would like to 
		  attend the adult dinner<br>&nbsp;<br>Good Morning ICFC,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This 
		  weekend at Iron City was hectic to say the least. On Saturday, the 
		  first Krispy Crunch challenge of the year took place, with many 
		  adorable rock bass being caught. Later in the day the Reeds hosted all 
		  of camp for cocktails following the rededication of the bridge. It was 
		  during this time that I discovered a passion for carrying vegetable 
		  platters, and serving $8 bottles of wine. <br><br>Afterwards, Richard 
		  exclaimed that he is hoping to have 2-3 more camp wide cocktail 
		  parties this summer, outlining plans to bring in a bartender and have 
		  Chez Henri cater. Later that evening the Johnson&#8217;s hosted the Saturday 
		  night party, and did not inform me that the jam I was using in the 
		  peanut butter and jelly sandwich demonstration was of the red pepper 
		  variety. <br><br>On sunday the Collins hosted a powerful vespers 
		  service outlining their experiences in the aftermath of the Tree of 
		  Life Synagogue shooting in 2018. It was a beautiful service and 
		  brought many of us to tears hearing of how the community responded to 
		  the tragedy. <br><br>Fishing in recent days has picked up 
		  significantly, pike and bass are being brought in high quantities. 
		  Finally, on July 16th we will have the Adult dinner so please get your 
		  reservations in and let us know if you are planning on coming. Looking 
		  forward to seeing you all soon!<br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey</p>

		  <p>Good Morning Iron City,<br>&nbsp;<br>Iron 
		  City is in full swing now, with numbers last night reaching close to 
		  160 people in the dining hall. However, they will soon tail off 
		  starting Sunday and into next week. <br><br>We are also in the midst 
		  of the hottest July weather I can remember. We have had three 
		  consecutive days of near 90 degree temperatures (30 degrees Celsius) 
		  with high humidity. Despite the warm weather campers enjoyed the 
		  Fourth of July festivities, showing the immense resiliency of ICFC 
		  members. Additionally, even with the lodge resembling a sauna than an 
		  Art Sale, campers persevered and managed to collectively open their 
		  chequebooks buying close to $11,000 of items. <br><br>In terms of 
		  fishing, Bruce Lawson caught a 9 pound 11 oz catfish and David Fritz 
		  caught a 9 pound 10 oz pike. Bass fishing is still somewhat slow, but 
		  getting better each day. In other news, the s&#8217;mores area next to the 
		  swim dock has been revitalized with new benches and a new fire pit, it 
		  is ready to tackle any and all marshmallow situations. The clothing 
		  store continues to be a frenzy, the new hot item: Baby Blue Long 
		  Sleeve T-Shirt. <br><br>I reiterate that I am open to sums of money 
		  being sent my way in exchange for preferential clothing. Looking 
		  forward to seeing you all soon! <br><br>Rah Rah Ray,<br><br>Jeffrey</p>

		  <p>Good Morning Iron City,<br>&nbsp;<br>Numbers in camp are steadily 
		  rising, reaching almost 160 in the next couple days. On Sunday even 
		  though the softball game was tied 8-8 the staff conceded the game 
		  because Jerry Rampelberg started to resemble a young Randy Johnson and 
		  was Un-hittable. Additionally, in the putting tournament Kerry Todd 
		  despite my best efforts won the Low Gross putting a 37, while Erin 
		  Heath and myself took home the low net with a 29. <br><br>Last night 
		  Canada Day celebrations were in full swing as my family hosted a lodge 
		  cocktail party on what turned out to be a beautiful evening. In the 
		  dining hall, Oh Canada was lead by my grandparents Don and Lorraine 
		  Lawson, who were the bedrock of a parade around the dining hall. As 
		  Frank Coyle brushed away tears from his eyes, he described it as the 
		  most beautiful moment since Marley &amp; Me. <br><br>Later this week on 
		  the 5th we have an art sale, and on the 6th we are honouring the new 
		  bridge. Additionally, the office is now offering a new service, with 
		  large donations to the staff fund you can now send potato sundaes to a 
		  person of choice. With so many events and attractions there are plenty 
		  of reasons to come up for an impromptu visit. <br><br>Pickerel 
		  continue to be caught as they make their way to deeper water, however 
		  bass are fairly scarce with only a couple being brought in each day. 
		  David Fritz however has managed to take an early lead for the biggest 
		  bass, by catching a 4 pound 10 oz bass a couple days ago. <br><br>The staff 
		  continue to do a great job in the dining hall and are rounding into 
		  form. Looking forward to seeing you all soon!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Rah Rah Ray,<br>

		  <p>Hello Iron Citizens,</p>
		  <p>Good Morning Iron City,&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The last few days in camp have 
		  been very eventful. Camp is picking up in terms of numbers in advance 
		  of july 4th, we are now using both sides of the dining hall. Pickerel 
		  continue to be caught in mass, and are much more common than bass 
		  (Nice Rhyme Jeffrey). Jamie Huber caught a 28 pound musky behind pikes 
		  peak, describing it as his favourite fish he has ever caught. In the 
		  back bay there have been multiple reports of a snapping turtle the 
		  size of a large serving platter. I have taken the liberty of naming 
		  the turtle Kawhi Leonard. Kawhi is very comfortable being 
		  photographed, however it is clear Kawhi could inflict some damage if 
		  he wanted. <br><br>Speaking of serving platters, the kitchen has been 
		  serving some incredible meals, including some tomato soup frank coyle 
		  described as better than san souci ice cream. I don&#8217;t know how those 
		  are even close to being related but it is indicative of the food so 
		  far. The staff are similarly doing great in the dining hall and have 
		  bonded in record time, things are shaping up to be a great summer. <br>
		  <br>We have an art sale coming up on July 5th with ten artists 
		  including the likes of Chief Lady Bird and Scott Barnim, there will be 
		  a ton of great stuff and please feel free to ignore your better 
		  judgement and buy a lot of things. <br><br>In other news, the black 
		  market for blue quarter zips is in a frenzy, multiple members have 
		  taken small mortgages in attempts to bribe me, however due to my high 
		  moral fibre I have insisted they contribute to the staff fund rather 
		  than my wallet. The staff is still in need of a speaker for the dining 
		  hall, and I am willing and able to sabotage people&#8217;s dietary 
		  restrictions to get it. We are looking forward to seeing you all soon!<br>

		  <p>Hello Iron Citizens,<br>&nbsp;<br>Camp is in full swing now and numbers 
		  are steadily increasing in numbers as we get towards 4th of july. The 
		  staff has been great thus far in the dining hall and are developing an 
		  undeniable team chemistry matched only by the 2019 Toronto Raptors.
		  <br><br>The Sunsets have been incredible, the combination of colour 
		  and some of the longest days of the year have made evenings at ICFC 
		  unforgettable. <br><br>The first fish of the season were brought in 
		  yesterday, with Carole Bramner catching a 4 pound catfish and Steven 
		  Heath catching a 4 pound pickerel. The water temperature and late 
		  spring have made bass fishing slow, however there are many pickerel 
		  being caught as evidenced by Steven. The water levels continue to 
		  fluctuate, depending on the day the main dock is either completely 
		  underwater or water is only lapping up on the edge. <br><br>Blue 
		  quarter zips have been the pillar of the clothing purchases so far 
		  with many of Iron City&#8217;s fashion icons sporting the sweater on a daily 
		  basis. I am now accepting bribes to set aside people&#8217;s sizes for when 
		  they come up, as we have almost completely sold out and are 
		  re-ordering. <br><br>We are still looking for a speaker loud enough 
		  for the staff in the dining hall, this will also be accepted as a 
		  bribe in exchange for favourable clothing. Hope to see you all up here 
		  soon!<br>&nbsp;<br>Rah Rah Ray,<br>&nbsp;<br>Jeffrey </p>

		  <p>Hello Iron Citizens, &nbsp; After a treacherous winter, and 
		  approximately 70 feet of rain this spring, the 139th encampment has 
		  begun! The maintenance staff has worked some minor miracles and camp 
		  is in beautiful condition. With about 50 campers for opening weekend, 
		  we would love to see some more of you up here soon! <br><br>Fishing 
		  season opened Saturday with exactly zero fish being brought in, 
		  however the great weather made sure it was enjoyable for all. A fawn 
		  was spotted running across the grounds until Moe promptly caught and 
		  released it. The staff are doing well, lots of training in the dining 
		  hall and around the grounds, however they are also bonding lots with 
		  hammock hangouts and swim dock visits. Water levels are at record 
		  highs, as most of the main dock is now underwater, and the waves are 
		  lapping up onto gas pump. The Saturday night party was hosted by the 
		  Chapples who quizzed the staff and members about current ICFC trivia 
		  while the reed&#8217;s hosted Sunday's vespers focusing on tolerance.&nbsp; <br>
		  <br>Iron City still needs some items, however, if you&#8217;re willing to 
		  donate them. The list of things includes a loud speaker for the staff 
		  in the dining hall and a projection screen for the lodge and will be 
		  updated as the summer goes on. &nbsp; <br><br>Rah Rah Ray! &nbsp; <br><br>Your 
		  Coordinator, &nbsp; <br><br>Jeffrey Hugessen</p>
