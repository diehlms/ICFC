	</b></font></u>Sooooooooooooooooo&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.it&#8217;s August&#8230;&#8230;already. I don&#8217;t think 
	that anyone here can believe it. We&#8217;ve been keeping very busy and have been 
	seeing a lot of new faces (which may be to blame for the lack of 
	bilging&#8230;.I&#8217;m truly sorry). But before I fill you in on the goings on of our 
	first &#8216;peak week&#8217; let&#8217;s talk about this&#8230;&#8230;. 
	<p>As we are all aware of, Iron City has a very&#8230;..well&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.we&#8217;ll call it 
	&#8216;family oriented&#8217; heritage about it. If you pass someone on the board walk 
	there is a good chance that you are related to them whether through blood or 
	marriage, at least a much much better chance than if you passed someone on 
	the sidewalk back home. So a few weeks ago, during one of our quiet morning 
	office hours Colin (Andrews) turned to me and asked me to help him make a 
	family tree. He was concerned that he really only knew his immediate family 
	and first cousins and there seemed to be so many other people around camp 
	who he was related to but didn&#8217;t know. Colin Andrews is my first cousin and 
	we are the grandchildren of Jack and Phyllis Andrews who was the third child 
	of Malcolm and Dorothy Reed (stop me if I&#8217;m going to fast for you). Anyway 
	as we were slowly working our way up through the branches of the extended 
	Reed family tree Caitlin Chapple walks in. Now Caitlin is the granddaughter 
	of Bennett Chapple III who&#8217;s sister Carolyn married David Reed. Naturally it 
	was necessary to add the Chapple clan on to the already large tree that we&#8217;d 
	created. A few hours (and a phone call to both my mother and Caitlin&#8217;s 
	father) and we had a beautifully intertwined Chapple-Reed Connection chart 
	(spanning 7 sheets of printer sized paper). Once this was hung on the wall 
	and admired we just couldn&#8217;t stop. As of now I am looking at the Crawfords, 
	Lawsons, Applegates, Scotts, Modics, Horner-Sipes, and the masterfully 
	worked Wright-Heath-Sillers-Brown-Anderson connection. We&#8217;re currently 
	working on the Kinnear-Jenkins, Dietrich-Swink, Succop-McCarthy and 
	Morgan-Firestone-Runnells-Garwood-Repplier family trees. It&#8217;s a fascinating 
	process and it seems like everyday there&#8217;s a new person in the office adding 
	something on or changing someone&#8217;s name- we welcome it all. So whenever 
	you&#8217;re in camp I invite everyone to take a few minutes in the office peering 
	over their family tree and correcting it or writing it down if we don&#8217;t 
	already have it. </p>
	<p>Ok now for a quick rundown of the past weeks events (so you can be 
	jealous if you&#8217;ve missed them). Last Friday was the SSCA picnic here in 
	camp, we were overrun with our neighbors on the bay and provided them a very 
	good BBQ lunch (thanks to John and our kitchen staff) music from the 
	Northern Lights Steel Drum and four local artists setting up their works in 
	the lodge. The whole event raised money for the Georgian Bay Foundation and 
	raised awareness for the water-level concerns and local wetlands. We had a 
	bug themed Saturday Night party hosted by the Boaks and the Jenkins and on 
	Sunday the Martins held a vespers service discussing the ways of being a 
	neighbor. Sunday afternoon the campers beat the staff in a very close 
	softball game. Tuesday evening the dining hall was over run with kids as 
	many adults went out on the first steak picnic of the summer and that same 
	night we had the second ICFC Reads book club discussing Water for Elephants. 
	Just yesterday was the second Iron City sponsored noon concert at the 
	Festival of the Sound, a few campers went for an afternoon of music and fun 
	in town. Yesterday was also the Todd Cup fishing tournament won by George 
	Galleher and we had a Beach day in the afternoon with a lot of fun races and 
	contests for the kids and a camper vs. staff volleyball game. As I type I&#8217;m 
	sitting with a glass of water and a tennis racket having just been ousted in 
	the first round of the Tolley Tournament. It&#8217;ll be going on through the 
	afternoon and we have quite a few competitive pairings. <br>
	</p>
	<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Whew&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I told you we&#8217;ve been busy&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.and today we have 125 campers 
	in the dining hall. </p>
	<p>We&#8217;re stilling looking out for all those faces that haven&#8217;t made it in to 
	camp yet&#8230;.cough cough reservations cough.<br>

	July 26, 2008:<br>



	</b></font></u>The days are lovely up here on Georgian Bay, for the last 
	week we have had weather that changes hourly, clouds and rain then sun and 
	breezes. Each day has ended with a beautiful sunset filling the western sky 
	with oranges and pinks and golds. Wednesday morning brought the Crispy 
	Crunch Challenge. A variety of small fish were caught off the main dock by 
	the small fry in camp. Everyone hooked a candy bar even if they didn&#8217;t hook 
	a fish. Later that afternoon, not to be outdone by the under 12&#8217;s Barbara 
	Boucek, Ciny Anderson and Ciny&#8217;s guest, Beth ---- brought in 3 bass totaling 
	almost 7 lbs.! </p>
	<p>Friday morning we awoke to beautiful sunshine and a cloudless sky, a 
	great day for the SSCA picnic. Our guests, all 85 of them, arrived at 11:30 
	and were greeted by members waiting on the main dock. Prior to lunch we 
	entertained our guests with a tour of camp, an opportunity to shop with the 
	artists in the lodge or a visit on our front porches. At noon the bell rang 
	and the steel drums of The Northern Lights began to play. We gathered in 
	front of the dining hall for a picnic lunch complete with onion sandwiches. 
	After lunch there was time to sit and visit, explore camp or shop, all to 
	the music of the steel drums. The swimming area was filled with children of 
	guests and campers taking advantage of the lovely day. By three o&#8217;clock the 
	guests were gone, the artists goods had been considerably thinned and camp 
	was enjoying the quiet of a sunny afternoon. </p>
	<p>Camp is filling up nicely now, each evening after dinner there are more 
	and more parents pushing their children on swings. The Bill Boak family is 
	in camp in full force; the Sillers Clan is following close behind. The front 
	bay is busy with tubers, skiers and wakeboarders. The dining hall din of 
	happy voices increases with each meal and the waitstaff is hitting their 
	stride. Charlie Burke is the Willie Wonka of the candy store and the 
	children gather &#8216;round after meals. Don&#8217;t delay, make your reservations 
	today, we can hardly wait to see you!<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<p><u><font size="4"><b>July 23, 2008:<br>



	</b></font></u>So as most of you know, Iron City is in fact a fishing club. 
	We do many other things, indeed I would consider the average day at ICFC to 
	be very athletically diverse, but in our roots we are a fisherpeople. Now 
	despite this I (and most of my family) am not known for my cast and reel. 
	When I tell people that I spend my summers at Iron City Fishing Club they 
	give me a weird look until I reassure them that I have actually never caught 
	a fish in my life.</p>
	<p>There are some bizarre things to be noted about fishing 
	as a sport. For one, you do not need to have great experience, or any 
	experience for that matter to catch a fish. Granted, knowing the right times 
	and places, having the best bait or lure, and having a skillful cast are 
	going to increase your chances of reeling in a big one, but really it all 
	comes down to whether or not the fish is going to bite. Last week our very 
	own Brian Douglass decided to take up some after dinner fishing. Though he 
	is not known to be an avid fisherman he pulled up a fair 2 ½ lbs. small 
	mouth bass and the very next evening hung a 4 ¾ lbs. pike up at the weigh 
	station. Impressive for a newbie, eh?</p>
	<p>Then the whole sport seemed to have a certain bandwagon appeal. Once 
	Brian started reeling them in others decided to try their own luck. There 
	were a few evenings where all phive of us were testing the waters off the 
	maindock. Even yours truly threw a line or two off the dock (though I don&#8217;t 
	think the fish were very interested).</p>
	<p>Now today is the Tom Collins Conservation Cup where all of our amateur 
	attempts will be upstaged by the masters. We haven&#8217;t seen any action yet but 
	the day is young and the whole camp waits with bated breath to see if Chris 
	Boit&#8217;s pre-breakfast outing will pay off.<br>
	</p>
	<p>Aside from the whole fishing thing, we&#8217;ve seen some other excitement in 
	camp this past week as more people come in. On Tuesday a few campers went in 
	to Parry Sound to see the noon concert sponsored by ICFC at the Festival of 
	the Sound. Just so everyone knows the Festival runs until August 10th with 
	concerts and events happening every day. We will be sponsoring two more noon 
	concerts on August 1st and August 5th if anyone is looking for a fun outing 
	in town during their vacation. Just yesterday our waterfront brightened up 
	significantly with the addition of a brand new bagel/doughnut/floating 
	trampoline contraption. The staff initiated it throughout the day with a 
	series of jumps, after all we have to make up for the past month of no 
	jumps. </p>
	<p>This Friday is the Sans Souci Copperhead Association picnic here in camp. 
	We&#8217;re all gearing up for an influx of friends and neighbors to our fine 
	property. The Northern Lights Steel Drum band will provide some 
	entertainment during our BBQ and we&#8217;ll have four artists selling their works 
	in the lodge as Iron City families lead our guest on tours around camp. </p>
	<p>August and peak are fast approaching and we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing 
	a full dining hall. Oh, and if you were interested in sending your 
	reservation in&#8230;.well&#8230;..I could probably take that off your hands for you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a resident &lsquo;elder&rsquo; (privileged
position) and one accruing many camper days (we all need to do our
part) the arrival of Cathy Collins presents competition for this
title.&nbsp; Barbara Boucek is also a healthy competitive
challenger!&nbsp; As many of our dear &lsquo;old friends&rsquo; vacated
camp by July 8, it looked like the next 2 weeks would be
quiet&hellip;.Not so!&nbsp; With the arrival of Lawsons, Jenkins,
Bennetts, Bushkoffs, Fritz families along came the wind, lightning,
thunder and torrential rain (no watering needed for Berta&rsquo;s
garden!)&nbsp; This proved to be excellent news for water levels being
10 inches higher but not good news for our wireless internet
connection!&nbsp; Services were generously supplied by 2 in camp.&nbsp;
It specialists; Ted Branch and David Fritz (staff helpers were Brian
Douglass and Brandon McCarthy) coming to the aid of several campers
i.e. Barbara Boucek and Cynnie Anderson, who were very grateful!<br>
      <br>
The fab five have been outstanding:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian Douglass displayed outstanding leadership
skills when the staff boating trip to Parry Sound happened upon serious
dense blinding fog.&nbsp; The three boats driven by Brian, Caitlin, and
Alex all returned to camp before the campers became seriously alarmed.<br>
Caitlin Chapple has the most perky, friendly happy personality who
greets us daily and her infectious warm smile lights up a room!&nbsp;
She is organized and aware of specific details for us campers.&nbsp;
Thank you Caitlin!&nbsp; Her birthday was on July 12th.&nbsp; It was a
most happy 21st celebration coupled with her best fight to try to not
go in the bay&hellip;.she lost four times!&nbsp; Fellow staff member
Courtney Anderson had recently celebrated her 15th birthday with four
surprise trips to the bay as well!<br>
Colin Andrews demonstrates unique and colorful attire on the ball field
and at Saturday night parties.&nbsp; He will be a very creative
engineer!&nbsp; He is doing a great job in the Dining room and office
working with his cousin Brian.<br>
Cary Douglass impresses campers and staff with her winning smile and
attention to office details.&nbsp; She has been out waterskiing a lot
and possibly learned from her neighbor Carrie Scott!<br>
Alex Johnson is everywhere!&nbsp; He has been noticed to be extremely
helpful as well as efficient and popular!&nbsp; It seems he has
inherited his brother Ben&rsquo;s Pied Piper effect.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carly Reed and Carrie Scott hosted an awesome
Saturday night party.&nbsp; The theme was &lsquo;come as your age
reversed&rsquo;.&nbsp; The staff clearly demonstrated bold creative
colorful attire, especially Cary as a baby and Colin as an aging camper
boater.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Modics came in full force&hellip;water sports
and socializing seem to be 24/7.&nbsp; Mark proved to be a lifesaving
golf cart escort to Barbara Boucek.&nbsp; Blaire tried hard to get
campers to show up for softball, but it was in vain&mdash;campers lost!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex Scott entertained us campers with his first CLI
(camper led initiative) on the Anderson porch with several contented
elders in tow!&nbsp; The addition of soprano Lisa Milligan and her
tenor husband Don Marcus was sensational!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A surprise visit from Larry Cripps accompanied by
George Milligan stunned and delighted Barbara Boucek and Cynnie
Anderson.&nbsp; The classic boat &lsquo;Artemis&rsquo; was repaired and
thus an evening ride ensued for us on this dream cruising vessel to the
open and North Channel.&nbsp; It was the calmest bay ever in the open a
truly magical event.&nbsp; Thank you George!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday July 15&mdash;only 25 campers in
camp.&nbsp; This is the quietest day of the summer as chefs Bill and
John told me while we enjoyed another delicious outdoor picnic and
barbeque.&nbsp; The staff was all in Parry Sound so the kitchen crew
was present and available.&nbsp; We noticed and appreciated, good
conversations ensued!&nbsp; The staff had their Parry Sound day by way
of the Iron City and the Douglass&rsquo;s boat.&nbsp; Everyone seemed
to enjoy their day on the bay and away from camp.&nbsp; Family reunions
these past two weeks included the Fritz and Collins families. &nbsp;<br>
Thursday July 16 &ndash;gearing up for new arrivals&hellip;all is well in camp on our magical Georgian Bay!!!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cynnie Anderson<br>
      <br>
p.s. The meals are outstanding! Kudos to John, Bill, and all kitchen staff especially Megan!<br>

      <br>
      <u><font size="4"><b>July 15, 2008:<br>



	</b></font></u>The Iron City birthday seems to have a certain bittersweet 
	quality to it. As I have always celebrated my anniversary in the dark cold 
	month of February, my opinion of it comes from a purely observatory 
	perspective, however, in the past week I have come to some conclusions that 
	I wish to share with you.<br>

	<br>

	On Tuesday young Miss Courtney Anderson turned 15 and received a well 
	decorated room, a delicious chocolate cake topped with sparklers left over 
	from the 4th, a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday echoing from the 
	dininghall rafters and a series of heaves off the main dock spreading from 
	midnight to midnight.<br>

	<br>

	This Saturday our very own Caitlin Chapple celebrated her 21st birthday and 
	received a rice krispy treat cake (it was a magnificent work of art) and 
	quite a few of her own involuntary swims.<br>

	<br>

	Now, I am a big fan of cake (especially when it has my name on it). I would 
	probably turn a shade redder being sung to in the dininghall but secretly I 
	would love it. And I would certainly be one to appreciate the view (the 
	swaying pines during daylight and the glittering stars at night) in those 
	moments between the release and the splash. But I would be rather averse to 
	the 24 hours of wet hair, a floor covered in wet clothes and the paranoia of 
	not knowing when and where you&rsquo;ll be attacked next. </p>
	
      <p>So here&rsquo;s to Caitlin and Courtney&hellip;.. </p>

	
      <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRLS! </p>

	
      <p>In other news, Carly Reed and Carrie Scott hosted a &lsquo;reverse your age&rsquo; 
	Saturday night party. Our staffers poked fun at their elders sporting high 
	waisted pants, funny hats, and even reading glasses, but hands down the 
	prize was given to Alex Scott and Chris Modic who threw it right back at 
	them with baggy, sagging pants, sports jerseys, iPods, and a distinct sassy 
	look. David Fritz gave a very thought provoking Vespers service about 
	science in the bible. I think more than one camper walked away wondering if 
	there really are still dinosaurs in the Congo.<br>

	<br>

	So let&rsquo;s talk about softball. Our first Sunday we opted for a camp wide 
	kayak paddle instead. Our second Sunday involved a less than stellar 
	performance by the staff (though we looked good). Our third Sunday nobody 
	joined us and thus the campers forfeited (though we looked good). And our 
	forth Sunday, despite a valiant effort by team Modic and friends, we walked 
	away victorious (oh&hellip;..and we looked good).<br>

	<br>

	We&rsquo;re preparing for another fantastic week up here on the bay. All of you 
	who are preparing to head up here and have yet to send a reservation&hellip;..I 
	shake my finger at you. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;<u><font size="4"><b>July 10, 2008:<br>



	</b></font></u>Yesterday the young staffers woke up as they usually do but 
	with a particular twinkle in each eye for this was to be the day of the 
	annual Parry Sound outing. They diligently served breakfast, cleaned the 
	dining hall, did some sidewalk sweeping and were released back to their 
	cabins to gather a few essentials and one lifejacket each. Fifteen waiters, 
	five leaders and one lucky kitchen staff member with the day off piled into 
	three boats. They were confident that the barbeque and arts and crafts would 
	be kindly handled by the kitchen staff and that no swimming tests would be 
	administered due to the lack of staff on this particular day. I love hippos. 
	With the image of 21 happy smiling faces, one would have absolutely no idea 
	that the morning weather was somewhat less than perfect. Three boats headed 
	out across the front bay, three boats slithered through the S-channel, three 
	boats rounded the red buoy&hellip;..and three boats came to a halting stop just shy 
	of the Yankanuck Club. For what had been a somewhat less than perfect 
	morning had brought forth a great wall of impenetrable fog. Three boats 
	glumly trudged back to camp bringing that wall of fog trailing behind them. 
	Though the original twinkles had transformed to tears, there is the promise 
	of next week.<br>

	</p>

	
      <p>We&rsquo;re relatively lonely here in camp after topping off at 106 people last 
	week we are now serving 41 campers&hellip;.its a 2:1 camper staffer ratio, we might 
	start assigning staffers to individual campers. Every camper pairs off and 
	gets one staff member to follow them around and take care of their every 
	need&hellip;.thoughts? </p>

	
      <p>The 4th of July was accompanied by beautiful weather and a fabulous 
	fireworks display from our very own Monty Scott and Saturday evening the 
	campers gathered on the spacious main dock for a mini-hootenany and sang 
	along with the musical stylings of Nick Steffey, Dick Boak, Peter Amerman, 
	Mark Groulx a trusty member of the maintenance staff who dazzled us with a 
	reworked rendition of his &lsquo;Moon River&rsquo;, and Ben Johnson who could not 
	respond to the calls for his &lsquo;I Wish I Were A Pilot&rsquo; but instead brought 
	down the house with a new ditty entitled &lsquo;How Many Kisses&rsquo;. </p>

	
      <p>Saturday morning our main dock and the Pierce Runnells memorial was 
	dedicated in a very touching service. Many people shared their personal 
	memories of Pierce and summers spent with him and the welcome bell resonated 
	across the glassy front bay. </p>

	
      <p>Sunday vespers the Hubers brought in special guests, their pastor and his 
	wife from Atlanta to give a sermon. </p>

	
      <p>I&rsquo;ll be thinking of all of you and your outstanding reservations (hint 
	hint) as I jump in the bay this afternoon. </p>

This past
Saturday, the extended Swink family hosted the Saturday Night Party

with Dan and Kathy Sager, and Jack Huber winning low gross.&nbsp; Yours
truly played for the first time in 25 years and if not for my partner
might have been a contender.&nbsp; Gary Johnson held the Vesper service
with the theme of Treasure Maps.&nbsp; Lilli Patton provided a
wonderful solo of Colors of the Wind, from the movie Pocahontas.<br>


      <br>


An
inexpensive (unlike gas) and plentiful wind encouraged Jaime Hugessen,
Brian Douglass and the team of Monty Scott/Jeff Firestone to sail to
the open yesterday.&nbsp; Reportedly, Brian, Monty and Jeff spent as
much time in the water as on the water but they are already planning
future trips.<br>

Hello members and friends alike,<br>


      <br>


Happy Canada Day!!!!!!!!!<br>


      <br>


Its
been a Swink family kind of week here in camp.&nbsp; The extended
Miller and Sager families make up a third of our campers (and a fifth
of our staff).&nbsp; Thus they hosted a Canadian themed Saturday night
party (red, white, maple leafs and lumberjacks appeared to be the best
representation of this great country) and Gary Johnson&rsquo;s vespers
service was overshadowed by the solo performance of young Lilli
Patton.&nbsp; <br>


      <br>


The putting tournament ended in a Sager-tie
between Kent and Amy Patton and Dan and Kathy Sager.&nbsp; This very
afternoon we&rsquo;re having the first annual John Sager mixed doubles
tennis tournament with quite a few father daughter pairings coming out
of the Sager family.&nbsp; Personally I am very excited about the
premiere performance of the team of Colin Andrews and Caitlin Chapple,
folks this should be one for the archives&hellip;.or so they&rsquo;re
saying.&nbsp; And to cap off the week of Swink, with the help of Renee
Miller, we are all looking forward to an exciting night of
BUNKO!!!!!!!!! tomorrow.<br>


      <br>


In other news we experienced a streak
of very windless days last week and the staff took advantage of the
glassy water to head out wakeboarding and skiing on multiple
occasions.&nbsp; It seemed that the only way to avoid the bugs was to
jump in a moving boat.&nbsp; The skis have since been traded in for
sails however as the wind picked up over the weekend.&nbsp; <br>


      <br>


We&rsquo;re
looking forward to seeing everyone with every reservation that we get
here in the office (and for those of you who don&rsquo;t have your
reservations in&hellip;.well do I really have to say it?)<br>


      <br>


Enjoy your Canada Day from where ever you may be.<br>

      <u><font size="4"><b>June 23, 2008:<br>



	</b></font></u>I have been asked by the Fab Five, Class of 2008, to write 
	the first daily Bilge for our 127th Encampment---what an honor. I have the 
	following to report for our first few days:<br>



	
      
      
      <p>1) We have a great leadership team, trained with Jake Morrow last Monday 
	through Wednesday, and showing very real signs of promising teamwork and 
	capability---we are very lucky to have Alex Johnson, Cary Douglass, Brian 
	Douglass, Caitlin Chapple, and Colin Andrews.<br>



	<br>



	2) The Sodexo team in the kitchen, led by John Saunders, has really got 
	their act together. Diana Milligan and her commissary committee have 
	revamped the meal planning to be simpler and of very high quality. If the 
	opening dinner of poached salmon and fresh vegetables is any indication of 
	things to come, you may be extending your planned days this summer!!<br>



	<br>



	3) Jan Fougere and the Headwaiters, Alex and Caitlin, did a wonderful job in 
	getting the wait staff trained to wait and work together as a team---so far 
	their waiting is impressive. This is a young group but highly motivated and 
	very well led by Caitlin and Alex.<br>



	<br>



	4)The Camp has never looked more beautiful-the new main dock, the beautiful 
	new stone stand for the Welcome Bell, the amazing landscaping carefully done 
	by Pam Reigeluth and her team, the water level is up 8 inches, Centennial 
	Bay renovation has been beautifully completed by Gary and Maurice and the 
	floors in the dining hall and the lodge just have to been seen to be 
	believed.<br>



	<br>



	5) The fishing is great----Dr John Sager caught a beautiful Great Northern 
	Pike over the weekend which weighed 9 pounds.<br>



	<br>



	6) To spare the Campers and Waiters being devoured by mosquitoes grandioso, 
	a kayak trip took place yesterday afternoon for almost the entire staff and 
	Fab Five.A number of waiters jumped off Baldy for the first time. The <br>

      <p>Gold Medal goes to Annie Lawson who was petrified and still is but she 
	jumped--her glee or was it fear could be heard all the way to Manitou.<br>



	<br>



	Iron City is ready to give you the best summer ever-come early and stay 
	late.<br>

      <p>As we all know the weather in the early season at Iron City can sway from 
	chilly 50 degree rainy days to sunny beautiful 70+ degree days. And we've 
	found that this changing weather largely determines our activities for each 
	day. So on last Monday when we the fabulous five arrived in camp we found 
	ourselves somewhat underdressed even in jeans and sweatshirts. What with the 
	cold weather, lack of wind, and the fact that it had rained 40 of the last 
	60 days the bugs have been in full force. <br>



	<br>



	Upon our arrival we (the five) found a small group of pre-season guests 
	avoiding the water and doing their best to stay out of the bugs but 
	otherwise enjoying everything that this place on the bay has to offer. We, 
	on the other hand, promptly set about training with Jake Morrow and planning 
	for a great summer for everyone. Our wait staff gradually trickled in and 
	started their training on Wednesday under the leadership of our 
	extraordinary headwaiters Caitlin Chapple and Alex Johnson and with the help 
	of Jan Fougere from Sodexo. All of the training and hard work culminated in 
	a very impressive opening dinner on Friday night with a grand total of 24 
	campers. Our President Nick Steffey gave a wonderful welcome to everyone and 
	declared Iron City's 127th encampment open. <br>



	<br>



	Saturday morning suddenly seemed like summer (say that 3 times fast) with 
	blue skies, lots of sun and the ability to walk around in shorts. That 
	evening our president hosted a cocktail party at his house with food 
	platters provided by the dining hall, a new offer that we would highly 
	recommend to anyone who enjoys throwing the occasional pre-dinner shindig. 
	All you need to do is let the kitchen know how many platters and what types 
	(cheese, fruit, seafood, etc.) and they'll have gorgeous and delectable food 
	ready for you. The staff hosted the first Saturday night party of the year 
	with the theme of black and white.<br>



	<br>



	Due to the small number of campers in this weekend we opted for a camp 
	kayak/canoe out to baldy in lieu of softball (and I think everyone was 
	relieved to avoid the bugginess that comes with that field this time of 
	year). Nick Steffey gave the opening Sunday vespers with the topic of old 
	friendship and I for one learned quite a bit about the history of our (how 
	many people know that we had also camped in northern Michigan before 
	settling here on the sandy beach).<br>



	<br>



	We're all settling in up here and getting used to some of the new scenery. 
	The main dock looks amazing and we've been getting plenty of use out of the 
	welcome bell in its new position. Get your reservations in soon, we can't 
	wait to have a full camp once again.<br>

      <p>See you on the Bay,<br>
