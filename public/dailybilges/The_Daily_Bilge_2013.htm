		  <p>The camp woke up this morning to a cold northern wind. Overnight 
		  the mid-70 highs had disappeared as the gusts sent the temperature 
		  plummeting to the 50s. Campers made their way to breakfast bundled up 
		  under coats, sweatshirts, and quarter-zips. Despite the chill in the 
		  air, a fearless group of picnickers endeavored to go out regardless of 
		  the weather. They were rewarded for their determination. The clouds 
		  parted and sunshine broke through to warm the rocks. The blue skies 
		  over head, the islands at O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s were stunning. </p>
		  <p>As happy as the day has been, there was a bit of sad news to temper 
		  the excitement. Today the staff lost its first member as Jake Brown 
		  departed for the summer. He will be missed and hopefully will be back 
		  up next year with his quick humor and one-liners</p>
		  <p>.</p>

		  <p>The weather has dramatically improved over the last week.&nbsp; The 
		  consistent sunshine has helped dry out camp from the weeks of rain.&nbsp; 
		  Last weekend saw a very creative Saturday Night Party thrown by Matt 
		  and Lindsay Weissberg.&nbsp; The games they brought to camp were 
		  tremendously fun and hopefully will find a way to stick at ICFC.</p>
		  <p>Sunday softball provided an opportunity for the wait staff to beat 
		  up on the campers.&nbsp; With a score of 17-3, the staff again 
		  outclassed its opponent in all aspects of the game and ruined Wally 
		  Jenkins&#8217; career ERA.&nbsp; At Vespers, Gary Johnson&#8217;s discussion on a 
		  connection between Biblical dreams and inspirational ones led some of 
		  the young staffers to ponder their future goals.&nbsp; Lastly, the 
		  Collins Cup went off without a hitch yesterday.&nbsp; Duey Savidge 
		  brought home the hardware after a hard day of fishing.</p>

		  <p>July 7th, 2017 is a date that will live in Iron City history.&nbsp; It 
		  was the day David Fritz seized from Don Lawson the most coveted of 
		  ICFC crowns with a camp record 5 lbs 13 oz. smallmouth bass.&nbsp; Few 
		  could think of a member more worthy of the achievement.&nbsp; Only the 
		  night before, David had regaled the camp with his fishing knowledge 
		  and secrets learned over the years.&nbsp; Despite the monster he brought 
		  in, Mr. Fritz is still convinced there are 7-pounders on the bay so 
		  there is still hope for Don Lawson to reclaim his title or for another 
		  challenger to throw their hat in the ring. </p>

		  <p>Happy Fourth of July from Canada!&nbsp; The weather has finally 
		  broke and it&#8217;s blues skies for the immediate future.&nbsp; It has been 
		  one of the wettest openings in camp history but hopefully that is in 
		  the rear-view mirror.&nbsp; The fishing this year has also gotten off 
		  to a slow start, but a combination of Bobby Reigeluth, the Fritzs, and 
		  the Applegate Clan are moving the count upwards.&nbsp; The devoted 
		  musky hunters, Jack and Brian Huber, even netted an impress 24 pound 
		  fish earlier this year.<br><br>Saturday was Canada Day and being the 
		  senior Canadian members in camp, the Lawsons hosted a cocktail party 
		  in celebration of their nation&#8217;s birthday.&nbsp; The Saturday Night 
		  Party, put together by the Douglass family, was unsurprisingly also 
		  Canada themed and featured the great northern talents of Justin Bieber 
		  and Michael Bublé.&nbsp; The rain again spoiled the Sunday morning 
		  putting tournament but cleared up to allow the wait staff to deliver a 
		  crushing 14 to 5 defeat to the campers.&nbsp; Jack Huber&#8217;s pitching 
		  was not enough to halt the offensive juggernaut that is this year&#8217;s 
		  staff, and Carly Phillips made sure to rub salt in the wound with her 
		  takeout slide of Bobby Reigeluth as he attempted a double play at 
		  second.&nbsp; Hopefully some new campers will arrive to provide some 
		  sort of challenge in the future, if not the staff&#8217;s dominance seems 
		  guaranteed.</p>

		  <p>It has been a wet first three days of camp, but weather can&#8217;t hold 
		  back Iron City Spirit.&nbsp; DeAnn Sloan and Nikki Wright Lusk 
		  graciously hosted the first Saturday Night Party on the opening night 
		  of camp.&nbsp; Activities included a grand march, an elimination 
		  dance, and the ICFC classic of pass the orange with the Staff.</p>
		  <p>Unfortunately with a heavy down pour on Sunday, both the putting 
		  tournament and the softball game fell victim to the rain.&nbsp; Sam 
		  Sipe gave an informative Vespers&#8217; sermon focusing on the history of 
		  Iron City&#8217;s relationship with Canada.&nbsp; Any camper interested in 
		  how the club&#8217;s view of our host country has transformed through the 
		  year should be sure to talk to Mr. Sipe.</p>
		  <p>The showers have continued into Monday but that has not deterred 
		  swimmers from the newly put out Bagel/Water Trampoline.&nbsp; The 
		  weather should break in the next couple of days, and to the enthusiasm 
		  of all those here Wednesday looks to be sunny!</p>
