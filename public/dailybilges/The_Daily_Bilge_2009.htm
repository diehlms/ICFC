  <u><font size="4"><b>August 18, 2009:</b></font></u><p>Dear Fellow Campers,<br>
	<br>
	An additional advantage to staying a few extra days in Camp could be the 
	opportunity to break records. Don Lawson broke a record today, a record held 
	by Jenny Wilson since 1937. Don caught a 6 pound 2 oz small mouth bass on a 
	worm near Pike's Peak. This is an historic day for Iron City and Don, as 
	well as his netman, one Jeffrey Hugessen. He has much to be proud of - 
	Congratulations, Don!!! Cheers,</p>
	<p>Nick</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Dear ICFC Members, </p>
	<p>Our head camper said that &quot;his enthusiasm exceeded his accuracy.&quot; Don 
	Lawson's small mouth bass did indeed break a club record, but it weighed 5 
	lbs 2 ozs. His email is lmdglawson@aol.com if you want to congratulate him 
	or get further details. It appears that Iron City really IS a fishing club. 
	The Todd Cup had the best stringers in years with David Fritz winning with 9 
	pounds of fish (which he released). Jordan Tadlock's friend, Ben Eppes, 
	caught a 4 lb 10oz (I think) small mouth bass on the afternoon of the 
	Semi-Annual meeting. GranJack Huber keeps catching muskie. I think we need 
	to get Sophia Crawford to add the taxidermist to the list of useful 
	telephone numbers in the yearbook. So, sharpen up your hooks and start 
	saving your money because you will want to spend all summer fishing in Iron 
	City next year. Hurray for Camper Days. </p>
	<p>Happy Canada, Annie</p>

	<p><u><font size="4"><b>August 11, 2009:</b></font></u></p>
	<p>Again I must apologize 
	for the lack of Bilge updates. This week has been quite hectic. Peak is 
	finally here. The numbers topped out at around 160. We had a beach day, the 
	Tolley Cup, the Scott shuffleboard tournament, and the Sillers putting 
	tournament is still going on. The Todd Cup and annual meeting are today, 
	another hootenanny on Friday, and the live auction is on Saturday, meanwhile 
	everyone is trying to get geared up for paddle dinner next week. </p>
	<p>We had a great turnout for the Tolley Cup with 12 teams all together. The 
	competition was tight like a new pair of underwear. Unfortunately, I was 
	knocked out in the first round by Chas Stewart and Katie Scott, but I didn&#8217;t 
	go without a fight. I&#8217;m still convinced they cheated. Mac Reed and Lisie 
	Sillers took on Bennett Reed and Barbara Boucek in the final match. The 
	crowd was going wild as they played first to win ten games. After some great 
	games and several impressive rallies, Bennett and Barbara pulled ahead and 
	won the tournament 10 games to 3. In his interview after the match, Mac told 
	the press that this defeat was something of a life lesson for him. He went 
	on to say that he would take a week or two off to reflect and then begin a 
	much stricter training routine upon returning home in preparation for next 
	year&#8217;s Tolley Cup. </p>
	<p>I personally did not get to go out and see the shuffleboard tournament, 
	though I heard it was quite the nail-biter. There were about 15 teams in 
	all, and the final match was won by Barbara Boucek (the new Iron City 
	tournament force to be reckoned with) and Nick Steffey. I overheard Katie 
	Scott saying she had not seen pucks slid that well since the Summer Olympic 
	Games of &#8217;76. Next year I will be sure not to miss it. </p>
	<p>We lost two of our staff members this past week. Stephen Firestone and 
	Jackson Reed both had to return home for sports and school. We are expecting 
	to lose four more this weekend, which is beginning to make me realize that 
	the summer is starting to wind down. </p>
	<p>That&#8217;s all I have for now. The weather is trying to be good for us. The 
	sun is out, and it&#8217;s fairly warm. I&#8217;ll get back to you with some stories 
	after the festivities of this weekend. </p>

	<p>Whoever prayed for Iron 
	City to finally get some warm weather, send me an email and I&#8217;ll buy you a 
	Crispy Crunch when you get up here. The past couple of days have been, for 
	the most part, hot and sunny and full of activity. And with camper days just 
	over 100 and still on the rise, it looks like it just might be a nice peak 
	after all. </p>
	<p>This week the Collins hosted their annual Collins Cup (small-mouth bass 
	fishing competition). Many people participated, but alas there can be only 
	one winner. Steven Heath came in second place with his small-mouth that 
	weighed in just under three pounds. And Marten Jenkins won the cup, reeling 
	in a bass that was nearly four pounds. </p>
	<p>We decided to organize a ping-pong tournament in the lodge on Thursday 
	afternoon. We had a great turnout for both the kid&#8217;s tournament (ages 13 and 
	under), and the adults (14 and up). For the kids it came down to a best of 
	three match between Grace Firestone and Sanders Bennett. In the tie-breaking 
	game, Sanders managed to out ping Grace&#8217;s pongs and take the gold. She 
	claims that it was one of the best accomplishments she has ever done and one 
	of the greatest matches of her life. The competition was very tight for the 
	adult crowd, but again, there can be only one winner. It all came down to 
	Jackson Reed and Todd Chapple, a modern day story of David and Goliath. Good 
	vs. evil. Right vs. Wrong. The crowd was going wild as each hit was faster 
	and harder than the previous. Todd won two games by the skin of his teeth 
	(which is actually quite gross when you think about it. Skin having teeth, 
	that is&#8230;but I digress). Jackson, no stranger to defeat, was a good sport and 
	will have an opportunity to win back his family&#8217;s honor this Sunday at the 
	softball game. </p>
	<p>We gained three new staff members this week. Charlie Burke returned for 
	his second summer with his younger brother, George, and their friend, Tom 
	Coyne. We are finally operating at full strength, ready to take on the 
	numbers at peak. Our last staff member, Elsie Widing, is expected to arrive 
	later this weekend, which will bump us up to 17 wait staff. </p>
	<p>That&#8217;s about all I have for now. This week looks like it will be pretty 
	exciting, so I&#8217;ll have to keep you posted with the details. Adios. </p>

	<p><u><font size="4"><b>July 17, 2009:</b></font></u></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	Greetings from Iron City. This past week has been, what we refer to as, the 
	calm before the storm. The high number of campers from the holidays dropped 
	down to around 30 for a couple days. Camp was quiet&#8230;almost too quiet. Now 
	it&#8217;s back on the rise and fast. Just shy of 100 campers, let&#8217;s hope this 
	week they&#8217;ll be able to field a decent softball team for once.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">The recent buzz around camp mostly consists of the 
	frequent bear sightings. It seems like almost everyone has seen one or more 
	bears snooping around. Cathy Collins saw a bear with its cubs climbing trees 
	on the back boardwalk.&nbsp; The Heaths saw some on the coast of reed bay while 
	fishing.&nbsp; And John Bennett claims to have seen two adult bears sword 
	fighting behind the lodge in what he described to be some type of wildlife 
	duel (bears will do almost anything to protect their family&#8217;s honor). I, for 
	one, believe him, and the idea of bears perusing about camp equipped with 
	swords scares me to death. I have seen several campers walking around with 
	whistles. In any case, it is nothing to get too worried about, but it should 
	be made known that they are around, and you should be a little more cautious 
	walking around at night when you get to camp.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Our July hootenanny, led by Alex Scott, was a success 
	and enjoyed by all. Guest performances included: Sasha Greendyk and Callie 
	Deslaurier singing and strumming, Irish dancing by Maggie Schroeder, and 
	singing by Riley Branch. Stephen Firestone had an original rap about his 
	mink that he performed with Alex Johnson beat-boxing by his side. Mark, Dan, 
	and Moe Gregoire from the maintenance staff all whipped out impressive acts, 
	most notably was Dan playing slide guitar with a beer bottle.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Another issue that I feel needs to be addressed is the 
	surprising number of large fish brought in to camp and how many of them are 
	not mine.&nbsp; Cathy Collins reeled in a four-pound walleye&#8230;yum. Rob Heath 
	landed a six or seven pound pike (biggest of the season). And Joe Bensy, 
	guest of Chris Modic, has been more than successful out on the Bay, stealing 
	small mouth bass from all the rest of us.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">The staff is having a great time. We took our staff 
	trip to Parry Sound on Wednesday and made a trip to Spider Bay on the way 
	back. Stephanie Nuel, Andrea Hylant, Jackson Reed, Stephen Firestone, John 
	Bennett, and myself all took the leap of faith and lived to tell the tale. 
	They like to wakeboard, take trips to Sans Souci, test the boundaries of 
	hammocks by stacking person after person onto it until it tears in half, and 
	dye each other&#8217;s hair! We had another staff member run out of gas while 
	wakeboarding, luckily she was able tilt the gas can from side to side, 
	collecting enough gas to make it back to camp&#8230;barely. Sometimes I wonder 
	about them.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Before I leave, I do have one more image I would like 
	to share with you all. One that I am slightly embarrassed about, but it 
	needs reported nevertheless. On Saturday night we had ferocious winds on the 
	Bay. And I don&#8217;t mean just dangerous for sailing winds. I&#8217;m talking about 
	tree bending, flag tearing, sweeping Jackson Reed off the ground winds. It 
	had been brought to my attention that night that it would be a good idea to 
	take the flags down to protect them from the wind. So there I am, lowering 
	the flags carefully and holding on for dear life. I get the flags to the 
	bottom of the rope when one whips me in the face and I lose my grip. And 
	like that they&#8217;re gone. The ropes, no longer tied down, flew into the air on 
	the end of the rope, dangling off the top of the flagpole. I look up 
	astonished at what I had done. How would I ever be able to get them down?! I 
	ran back to my porch to find John Bennett. We frantically McGeivered a very 
	complicated emergency flag-rescuing device (tetherball tied to a long rope, 
	tied to an even longer cable of some sort). We tried to heave the ball over 
	the flag ropes&#8230;didn&#8217;t work. We tried to punt the ball over the flag 
	ropes&#8230;didn&#8217;t work, and actually ended up getting our device tangled in a 
	tree in front of the dining hall. Just when we thought we&#8217;d have to call the 
	Gregoires to come and save the day, John mustered every ounce of strength he 
	had. He embraced the power from all the wheaties he has eaten over the years 
	and focused his energy on this one task. Using his delicate balance of grace 
	and power, John was able to capture the flags and save them from certain 
	doom.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Other than that, camp has been running very smoothly. 
	It&#8217;s been mostly sunny and breezy, the flags are back up, the McCarthy&#8217;s are 
	gearing up to host an awesome Saturday night party, and we have no zombie 
	outbreaks to report thus far. As always, don&#8217;t forget your reservations.&nbsp;</p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>July 7, 2009:</b></font></u><p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Jack 
	Huber landed a 48&quot; 31.5 lb musky which he caught while trolling between 
	Pikes Peak and Fly Bay. He hooked, fought and netted the fish while 
	maneuvering his boat away from rocks and an island - all single handedly. 
	Jerry Rampleberg captured the scene via the attached photo when Jack 
	returned to camp to untangle and disengage the musky from the net. Jack 
	revived and released the musky. Life is good!&quot; </p>

  <u><font size="4"><b>July 7, 2009:</b></font></u><p class="MsoNormal">Hello, 
	everyone. Sorry you haven&#8217;t heard from us in a while, but camp has been 
	err&#8230;eventful this past week. We&#8217;ve had one staff member take a trip to Parry 
	Sound hospital (don&#8217;t worry she&#8217;s back and everything is okay), a blown 
	transformer shooting sparks followed by a power outage, Canada Day, the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	of July, and our usual Saturday night party and Sunday activities. And with 
	our July hootenanny tonight and bunko night tomorrow, it doesn&#8217;t look like 
	we&#8217;re going to get a break any time soon.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Two more staff members, Stephen Firestone and Jackson 
	Reed, have arrived, so now we&#8217;re up to 3 guys. Yay! The entire staff seems 
	to get along well and their normal activities include: king of the dock, 
	sleeping on the swimming dock, wakeboarding, and often spontaneously 
	breaking out into dance. Seriously, if you walk past the dining hall right 
	before or after a meal and don&#8217;t see someone gettin&#8217; jiggy with it, I&#8217;ll eat 
	my hat (I think that&#8217;s the first and last time I&#8217;ll use that expression).&nbsp; 
	On Friday the staff took a trip to Sans Souci for ice cream and a quick dip 
	at Teddy&#8217;s. Three or four hours later we began to worry quite a bit and just 
	when we&#8217;re about to send a search and rescue party, sure enough we get a 
	call that one of the boats ran out of gas and they were towing each other 
	back very, very slowly. We thought it provided them with a great opportunity 
	to bond and really get to know each other. Or at least it was a learning 
	experience; I bet they&#8217;ll check the tanks before they leave next time.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Our numbers in camp spiked over the holidays as usual, 
	though still short from last year. I guess it&#8217;s because of that whole 
	economy thing. The Sipe&#8217;s hosted a camp-wide cocktail party and chartered 
	the new Iron City to ferry people from main dock over to their cottage in an 
	effort to avoid the muddy trail that leads up to their cabin. I suggest 
	everyone check out the new Iron City when you get into camp by the way, if 
	you haven&#8217;t done so already. I heard a rumor that it actually belonged to 
	Batman, but he had to sell it when the stock market plummeted. Nevertheless, 
	it makes Big Ben look like a child&#8217;s toy.&nbsp; On the 4<sup>th</sup> the Johnson 
	family hosted another camp-wide cocktail party, we enjoyed superfluous 
	amounts of cake in the dining hall, and the camp piled on the Iron City once 
	again to drive over to Lion&#8217;s Bay and light off some big fireworks.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">On Sunday the campers somehow managed to pull off a win 
	in the softball game. I will admit, however, that it was one of the most fun 
	games I have played in all four years I have spent on staff.&nbsp; The 
	competition was tight, everyone had fun, and there were some surprisingly 
	amazing plays made. Some of these might include Alex Johnson&#8217;s sabercat-like 
	reflex catch. Kyle Stricker sent a ball screaming toward first base and 
	Johnson stretched out without hesitation to snag it out of the air before I 
	had a chance to blink. John Bennett forced a crucial triple play in the 
	fourth inning. Then in bottom of the last inning, staff down by one run and 
	bases loaded, Stephen Firestone stepped up to bat. He ripped a shot down the 
	third base line, but Kyle Stricker managed to jump and knock it down. He 
	picked it up and tagged the base to force the third out before we could get 
	a run in.&nbsp; And Jackson Reed tried his best.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">That&#8217;s all I have, folks. It&#8217;s a little colder today 
	than most would like, but lunch is cream of tomato soup and grilled cheese. 
	Boo ya! Until next time&#8230;&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">The Fab Five,</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Colin Andrews, Alex Johnson, Katie Scott, Brita 
	Bergland, and John Bennett</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	
  <u><font size="4"><b>June 27, 2009:</b></font></u><p class="MsoNormal">So here 
	we are again, beginning the 128<sup>th</sup> Encampment on the Georgian Bay 
	and happy as can be. I will do my best to inform you all about the events 
	that have taken place thus far&#8230;&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Myself (Colin Andrews) and the rest of the &#8220;fabulous 
	five&#8221; that are in camp so far (John Bennett, Katie Scott, and Brita 
	Bergland) arrived last Friday evening and Saturday morning just in time for 
	a cold, rainy Iron City day. We started our leadership training, led by Jake 
	Morrow and Tyler Steffey, on Saturday night and finished up by Monday 
	morning. John and Brita are now starting to get in the swing of things in 
	the dining hall as headwaiters, and Katie and myself are trying to get 
	everything organized in the office and ready for the season as coordinators 
	until our fifth leadership team member and Bookkeeper, Alex Johnson, 
	arrives.&nbsp; The weather has been absolutely beautiful and to say we are 
	excited and ready for an amazing summer on the bay is an understatement.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Our wait staff trickled in throughout the weekend and 
	early this week. It includes first year staffers Callie Deslaurier, Sasha 
	Greendyk, Amy Moore, Andrea Hylant, Clare Bogart, Riley Branch, and Anderson 
	Lidz and returnees Stephanie Neul, Courtney Anderson, Jen Collins, and Annie 
	Lawson. Now before you say anything, I know exactly what you&#8217;re thinking. 
	One guy?! We know. But don&#8217;t worry because Stephen Firestone and Jackson 
	Reed will be arriving in a couple days, and we have a couple more staffers 
	arriving later in July. For the time being I think John and I will just have 
	to give him as much testosterone as we can, making sure to do plenty of 
	manly things like grunt and play with snakes while he contemplates whether 
	being the only guy on a staff of 10 girls is a good thing or a bad thing.&nbsp; 
	On Tuesday they trained in the dining hall before we went on a picnic, 
	promptly followed by a canoe trip to baldy, which was fun especially for 
	some of our first time jumpers. Did I forget to mention that some of our 
	staffers have never even been to Iron City let alone baldy? In the evening 
	we had a campfire on the beach and some musical performances by Sasha and 
	Callie, who were amazing to say the least. They all finished up training 
	with Jan Fougere on Wednesday and are now ready for the real deal.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Our head chef, John Saunders, and his team in the 
	kitchen have been on their game as usual. We have had five successful meals 
	in the dining hall and many more to come. As a side note the kitchen is 
	offering much more catering this year, including the platters from last year 
	and adding a themed special events menu to the mix. You will also be able to 
	buy your basic grocery or supply needs for your cabin straight from the 
	kitchen this year (i.e. milk, eggs, bread, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">On Sunday afternoon, John and I spotted a tiny snapping 
	turtle outside the staff cabins. We decided instantly to adopt him as our 
	staff pet, appropriately naming him Bowser for his spiky shell and pointy 
	tail. We let Bowser hang out in staff land as we ran to a quick meeting with 
	the rest of our fab 5 and the intent to make a proper home for him when we 
	came back. How far could a little baby turtle go right? Wrong! We returned 
	to find Bowser nowhere in sight and not even so much as a note saying 
	goodbye. It was a rough day for John and I, though we eventually grew to 
	accept it and felt he deserved his freedom. Then on Wednesday the 
	unbelievable happened. We found another turtle, Bowser&#8217;s cousin, just 
	outside the dining hall. His name became Michelangelo due to the large 
	resemblance to the teenage mutant ninja turtle. You know, the orange one 
	with the nun chucks. Michelangelo was everything you could ever ask for from 
	a turtle. All the girls loved him and all the guys wanted to be him; he had 
	it all. Michelangelo spent two lovely nights with us, but last night we 
	decided it was time to part ways. We released him back into the wild to lead 
	a happy life and fulfill his turtle destiny in the world. We will keep them 
	both in our hearts and their short time spent with us will never be 
	forgotten. And the last story I will share with you all is one of an age-old 
	tradition here at Iron City, the ringing of the bell before meals. Yesterday 
	Anderson was asked to ring second bell before lunch. John advised him to 
	ring it loud so everyone could hear.&nbsp; Sure enough, after seven loud gongs on 
	the bell with our brand new sledgehammer, the sledge cracks and breaks in 
	two just below where the mallet head attaches. Anderson looks up slightly 
	confused and scared at what he had done. Then he decides to continue 
	smacking the bell with what was left of the wooden handle the full twenty 
	times before giving up.&nbsp; That&#8217;s dedication.&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Right now it&#8217;s about 75, sunny, and the water is up 
	somewhere between 12-16 inches. As always get your reservations in and have 
	a splendid summer.&nbsp;</p>
