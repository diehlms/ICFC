</font>Stephanie, Stacy and my father will be arriving in camp on July 29 via air while I will arrive the next day with the car 
after having enjoyed 13 hours of peace and quiet on the road. The girls and I are going to SF in July to see Wesley and family and 
then on to Yosemite for biking, hiking and camping. I see that Dick and Sue Boak will also be there in July so maybe we can arrange 
to meet up at some famous landmark for an ICFC reunion. This is my year for national parks. I just got home from a 10 day biking 
trip to Bryce Canyon, the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Lots of miles, great weather and astounding canyons. While I was off 
biking, the girls went off on a road trip to grandparents in the Midwest, with many stops at interesting places on the way including 
4 days of bass fishing in Kentucky. I haven't heard yet how it compares to IC fishing. Can't wait to see everyone.</p>

<b>Collins Family </b><font color="#000080"> (Contributed 6/20/04 by Megan)<br>
</font>Megan is finished with eighth grade and Jen with fifth. We started our summer traveling to Duck North Carolina. Of Course Mom 
made us fly in a day early to have a learning experience by visiting Jamestown and Yorktown..&nbsp; We went to Duck with the 
Bushkoff Clan.&nbsp; Renting a mansion on the beach for the whole family, (24). We spent a week there. Mom, dad and I came home 
leaving Jen there to stay east for the summer. My Parents are sending me to Australia and New Zealand for 3 weeks on the 23 of June. 
Mom flies east July 1st to meet Jen who is spending time with her cousins in D.C. They head up to camp with Nanny Ina and Nanny 
Annie on the 10 of July. Dad waits for me to get back on July 11. We than come up to camp on the 14th. We will be there until the 31 
of July. We can't wait to see everyone!</p>

<p><b>Allie Scott Bonidy</b><font color="#000080"> (Added 6/17/04)<br>
</font>Well after almost a year of marriage, we are finally settled in Pittsburgh. Joe is working for Combinenet in a sales position 
which he really enjoys, and gets quite a bit of time on the golf course. I am working 3 days a week at a Catholic School, St. Bede, 
teaching Spanish grades K-8. I work Mon., Tues., and Weds....not bad for long weekends away!! We have had some great long weekend 
travels to Jackson, WY, San Francisco and Winter Park, FL for the Boucek wedding. It's always fun to see people during the year! We 
will be up for a few days in June with Joe's parents when camp opens, and I will be back for 2 weeks in early August. Joe will be 
coming up for long weekends!! We look forward to seeing everyone there!!</p>
<p><b>Nancy Stronach Abramson </b><font color="#000080"> &nbsp;(Added 6/17/04)</font><b><br>
</b>We had a son, Daniel Edward, III on June 2. He will make his Iron City debut this summer in mid July.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Dick Boak Family</b><font color="#000080"> (Added 6/17/04)<br>
</font>The combination of increased membership costs added to a summer with many conflicting commitments has caused us to skip ICFC 
this year. We're sad about that. We'll be out in Yosemite in July for a few weeks with the girls instead, but hope to be in camp 
again for the 2005 season. Love to all, Dick Boak and &quot;the girls.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Heather and Jeff Firestone </b><font color="#000080"> (Added 6/17/04)</font><br>
After forgoing ICFC for Italy last year, we look forward to returning to camp in late July through early August.&nbsp; This year 
Stephen (11) has been pursuing his passion for all things sports and is again showing character as a long suffering Cubs fan.&nbsp; 
He will be happy to take on any of you on one of the ICFC ping pong tables.&nbsp; Andrew (9) is spending much of June and part of 
July at his camp outside of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; He looks forward to spending a day at Kennywood.&nbsp; Gracie (6) had a big soccer 
season with her dad coaching the team.&nbsp; She and her teammates enthusiastically dubbed themselves &quot;The Kicking AstroKats!&quot;&nbsp; 
This was something of a compromise between the boys choice of names like &quot;The Killers&quot;, and &quot;Astros&quot;, and the girls preference for 
names like &quot;The Pink Kitty Cats&quot;.&nbsp; Jeff recently won a Davis Cup rules tennis match and was awarded a monogrammed blue blazer 
(largely due to the superior talents of the other 4 players on his team).&nbsp; Unfortunately, he really can't wear this Major Award 
to work, church, or any other public occasion, and Heather has ceased being impressed when he wears it at home.&nbsp; However, 
following the example set by some members of the Todd family, Iron City would seem to be the perfect place.</p>
<p><b>The Schroeder Family</b><font color="#000080"> (Added 6/16/04)</font><b><br>
</b>The Schroeder's have enjoyed some great times together this year beginning with a couple of trips to our little beach cottage on 
Bald Head Island - which we fondly refer to as &quot;Iron City South.&quot; March took us to Ireland for 10 days to meet some of Berta's 
family and of course, we made time for some Irish dancing for Maggie! When we weren't driving around the countryside (or in the 
pubs), we chose to spend a lot of time on horseback....and to me, there is no finer way to enjoy the beauty of Ireland than from the 
top of a &quot;harse&quot;....as they say over there. Back injuries aside - we had a really great trip! It was back to Bald Head over Easter 
where we enjoyed stunning weather and alot of lying around, then it was off to ICFC over Memorial Day to be reunited with friends 
and family....one of our very favorite times to be in camp. </p>
<p>The &quot;Irish-Jig Mobile&quot; makes it's way North from the Carolina's on July 23. There will be a quick pit-stop in St. Catherine's for 
an Irish Dance competition on July 24. Maggie's feet are on fire these days! She has reached a higher competition level this year, 
so the bar is a bit higher now. However, if she keeps dancing the way she has been - she's sure to continue to do very well. It's 
such a joy to see her do well, but most of all, to just have fun! &quot;Nancy/Mom/Nana,&quot; will join us in our travels to Iron City this 
summer, so we look forward to having a fun trip together. We'll all be in camp July 25 - August 13 and hope to connect with as many 
of you as possible!<b><br>

Bette and Bob Bogus </b><font color="#000080"> (Added 6/17/04)<br>
</font>The beloved Bogus family, whose memorable updates have appeared in the <a href="http://icfc.net/archive">Bilge</a> in recent 
years, are quite upset to learn of an unfounded rumor that they do not, in fact exist.&nbsp; In a fit of solipsism, they have chosen 
to give no answer to this baseless charge.<br>
<br>
<b>The Reigeluth Family</b><br>
Bob Reigeluth retired last fall from his full-time career as a sportswriter and is now working freelance. He and Pam plan to move to 
Venice, Florida, in June. Once they've unpacked, they will visit Iron City at some point over the July 4th holiday and then divide 
the rest of the summer between Iron City and the family's cottage in Old Saybrook, Conn., before returning to Florida in October. 
Bob's mother, Mary Applegate Fisher, and her husband, Everett, are also moving this June, from one house to another in Greenwich, 
Conn. Bob's youngest son, Tom, has been promoted to Captain in the Army and is now serving in Afghanistan. Middle son, Rob, has 
moved to Hope, N.J., where he is general manager and head pro at a golf club. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Huber Family<br>
</b>We are looking forward to getting back to Iron City this year after missing last summer. Our newest addition, Jamie, will have 
just turned one and big brother Campbell is looking forward to showing him sandy beaches, playgrounds and boats. We plan on being in 
camp August 4-14 with a return trip for my father and me the second weekend in September. </p>
<p><b>Barbara Boucek <br>
</b>This is Barbara Boucek. Our family has some exciting news. My son Braden was married to Monica Cox, a lovely girl, on April 3 in 
Winter Park, Florida. We were very pleased by the large number of their Iron City friends and our family that attended. Braden 
intends to bring Monica to Camp this summer so that she can meet the rest of the Iron City family and everyone can meet her. 
Marshall Stronach is marrying Scott Creighton on June 5th in Nags Head. Scott and Marshall will be in Camp in mid-July with their 3 
daughters, Eleanor and her two new sisters. Dan and Nancy Stronach Abramson are expecting their first child, a son, at the end of 
May <i>(Editor's note - See the Abramson's Bilge entry above for an update)</i>. All the Stronach's will be in Camp together in and around the 3 week of July. </p>
<p>I will be bringing my Mom (Eleanor Heath) to Camp on Opening day and our hope is that she will be able to stay up for the entire 
summer. Other Boucek news is that Jenny is in her second year of coaching the WNBA Seattle Storm and Heath has now graduated from 
the University of Virginia. Braden is now Assistant District Attorney of Williamson County in Tennessee. </p>
<p>We are eagerly looking forward to the cool weather and warm camaraderie of Iron City. </p>
<p><b>The Fritz Family <br>
</b>The Fritz's are in wedding mode, anticipating the grand event in June. Hoping to see many over Memorial Day weekend '04!&quot; </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Bennett Family</b><br>
After a long year, Charde and Dave plan to be in Camp the 2nd two weeks of July. Dave III and Christine with Hallie will be in the 
last 2 weeks of July and Andy and Paula and family the first two weeks of August. John and Stew will be on staff this summer to 
cater to your every need. Hope to see many friends and hope the higher water level continues. </p>
<p><b>The Amerman Family<br>
</b>Both Cynthia and Alex graduated in 2004--Cyndy with an MSW from Gallaudet University and Alex from George Washington University 
with a degree in International Development Studies. Doris, Alex &amp; Cris, Gregg &amp; Peggy and Peter were all in town to attend. Alex 
currently works as an intern for the Sustainable Energy Institute in Washington, DC: <a href="http://www.s-e-i.org">www.s-e-i.org</a>. 
For those of you who don't know, Lyn and Marc Brabant were married in Jamaica, where our family enjoyed the festivities in a 
spectacular setting. The big news is the birth of Sofia Soliel Brabant in Tucson, AZ in December, picture attached (at 3 months). 
Cyndy moves back to New Jersey in June, where Peter has three years until his retirement from Blair Academy. Blair graduation at the 
end of May marks the beginning of travels to Tupper Lake NY, Guatemala and Iron City. We'll be in camp in August and may sneak up 
before that (of course, we will advise the staff!). </p>

</b>The Richard Reeds are happy to report that Bennett graduated from George Washington University on May 15th. He will be spending 
the next two years in New York City teaching elementary school for Teach for America. Carly finished he sophomore year at Colgate 
and is in Pittsburgh this summer attending summer school to develop her Spanish proficiency. Mac completed his sophomore year of 
high school and is eagerly awaiting his return to ICFC as the athletic director. We plan to be in camp for a few days in June to 
deliver Mac and then back again in early August. Hope all are well, and we look forward to seeing everyone on the bay. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Douglas Family<br>
</b>The Douglass family has had a great 2004, so far. Andy will attend Carnegie-Mellon University in the undergraduate school of 
business. He had a great swim season, capped off by breaking a 26 year old school record in the 500 freestyle. He plans to swim at 
CMU. Brian will attend Brevard College in Brevard, NC, right in the middle of water kayaking and mountain biking country. Brian just 
qualified for and will compete in the Junior Nationals in rowing in Boys Varsity 2X, which are the first weekend in June. Both boys 
are working for Wilderness Voyagers (whitewater rafting company) again this summer but have scheduled ICFC time in August. Not to be 
left out, Cary, also a rower, just missed qualifying for the Junior Nationals in Girls Junior 4+. Since her boat is all sophomores, 
they will be serious contenders next year. Cary is looking forward to another summer on staff. Douglasses will be at ICFC over 
Memorial weekend, to drop off staff in June, over July 4th and for a stretch in August. </p>

<p><b>Monty Scott </b><br>
Alls well with Brian and I hope you and yours are doing great. We plan to be up around the 15th of July through the 25th. Hope we 
may overlap with you. Had a great winter. Was in Utah in late January to ski with my goddaughters Megan and Jennifer Collins as well 
as Cathy and Rip at Alta what else do you need to say. Went on a wonderful ski trip with mom and Riley, Darcy's oldest(10) in 
February to Switzerland. We went to Zermatt and Cervinia, Italy. Had perfect weather. Sunshine every day. Skiing under the 
Matterhorn was spectacular. Had a fun weekend with The Branch's at Hoilmont in Ellicottville, NY for a ski weekend in March with 
mom. Brian made it to Florida to visit some friends for a week and came back relaxed and tan after having sailed around down in the 
Keys. Brian was also able to find a horse this spring so we are now a two horse family with Sunny and Bailey. Really enjoying the 
whole riding experience. Really looking forward to going to ICFC for Memorial Day weekend with mom and Darcy's family. Then again in 
July for 10 days the 15th to the 25th and a return in August and then again for Labour Day. </p>
<p>That's all for now. See you all on the bay. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Cris and Alex Scott<br>
</b>David and Will look forward to another summer working at ICFC and rooming with Stewart and Mac. This is a cohesive staff, with 
many visits during the year from out of towners, who dropped in in Nov., Dec/Jan and Feb. for various events. We hope this 
translates to jobs' well done. Carrie returns from 3 years in Jackson Hole to go back to school at Pitt. We will have everyone in 
Pittsburgh for the first time in many years!! We plan to be in camp for the opening, 2 weeks in early August, and some out of season 
time. </p>
<p><b>The Sloane Family </b><br>
Wally and Tallie again arrived in camp for a short weekend as soon as the ice retreated before the end of April. Funny thing this 
year - we were greeted on the dock by George Milligan who was supervising the start of the dredging of the new Centennial Bay 
channel. We took over his position, and continued with Chip Crawford to pretend to direct Moe in his endless churning, turning and 
burning in the excavator to get the complete job finished in record time. We can now entertain a yearly water-ski extravaganza in 
Centennial bay - boats and skiers never having to even exit outside the Reed Bridge. </p>
<p></p>
<p>OK, that was a bit of a stretch. It snowed and rained - a bit of it freezing - but we have to inform the members - if you have 
NEVER visited Iron City outside of the encampment dates, you might try to do so one day. The work that goes on when we aren't there 
is incredible. Oh, by the way - when you are there then, thank the Gregoire's - in all of their ever increasing numbers. We are 
blessed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Tallie and I will be in camp with or without Sloan Boys as they become available all summer. In fact, we personally challenge any 
of you to be there when we are not, and a Crispy Crunch to everyone who has been there a week without seeing us. Kids included. 
Grandparents especially included. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For those who have not ventured to Monague and had a tour of our cottage - please make a point of it this year. We are very 
pleased with it, and are more than happy to share. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh yeah - family news. CJ is engaged to his dear Deann who some of you have met - date is set for June 18th, 2005 - at Wally 
World of course. Eric is &quot;taking an extra lap&quot; at UOE - having changed his major to art - he's blowing glass and loving it - what 
better a place. Brian has been accepted at Kenyon College in mid-Ohio, where he will try his hands and feet at college swimming 
after becoming a high school state champion swimmer in PA. Thank you, Pikes Peak! </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, based on our experience we ask - Could there ever on the face of this earth be a better place to raise your children 
than at Iron City - summer after summer? Come early, stay long - it is good for our souls! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chip and Michel Crawford </b><br>
&quot;The WW Crawford's will be in camp for a week over Memorial Day, a week prior to camp opening, and the first two weeks of August. 
Shannon will be with us in August. Bryce, Kyle and Crawford will be in camp a number of times during the summer....mostly weekends. 
The Crawsnest will be jumpin; with the Crawford's, Galleher's and Tadlock's together for the first week of August. How many campers 
can fit in a Gazebo? Come see. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you George Milligan for coordinating the Centennial Bay dredging project. The appearance is much better than the 'low tide 
effect 'of the past couple of summers. Thank you Gregoires for the quality work to awaken camp from winter hibernation. And, thank 
you 'Mother Nature' for being kind to IC this winter.&quot; Chip and Michel </p>

<p><b>Kate and Scott Boak<br>
</b>Kate and and I still enjoy our simple existence in Maine: Scott hikes with his dog, while Kate pines for the shopping in Boston. 
But Ann Taylor is coming to Portland, so people are generally happier these days. By the time spring fully arrives, it will be 
summer in Iron City, and it will be time to head to camp. We plan to drive this year via the great Canadian cities of Montreal, 
Ottawa and Port Carling. It looks easy enough on paper. Hmm. Our route should put us in camp at the end of July - just in time for 
the Great Boak Gathering, 04'. The highlight will be meeting our new niece, Eleanor (Ella) Musgrove - Loren Boak's daughter. We also 
look forward to seeing all of our friends, baiting our own hooks, and the (very) remote possibility of Scott's catching a fish. </p>

<p><b>Leslie and Brian Huber<br>
</b>We are looking forward to getting back to Iron City this year after missing last summer. Our newest addition, Jamie, will have 
just turned one and big brother Campbell is looking forward to showing him sandy beaches, playgrounds and boats. We plan on being in 
camp August 4-14 with a return trip for my father and me the second weekend in September. </p>
<p><b>Kathy and Todd Chapple<br>
</b>Not much going on in the last year. We welcomed Oliver Bennett Chapple (yes, that's #4) last April '03. We moved from Avon, CT 
to Denver, CO last August.&nbsp; I changed companies in July '03, and in December '03 launched an Online Insurance Agency (<a 
href="http://www.netquote.com">www.netquote.com</a>) that currently operates in 10 states expanding to 43 by the end of 2005. <br>
<br>
We are planning to be in Iron City for just four days from July 12th to the 16th on the tail end of a 5 week road trip from Denver 
to Cape Cod going back to Denver by way of ICFC. For some reason, we were unable to make it last year and so we are determined to 
make it to the bay this summer.&nbsp; I can't wait to see Caitlin Chapple (my niece) waiting tables.&nbsp; I hear she is quite good.
<br>
<br>
See you soon.</p>
