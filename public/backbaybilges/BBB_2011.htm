<p class="MsoNormal">Hi to all our ICFC friends,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Martin kids will pretty much be in charge of your stay 
this summer!! &nbsp;Actually, Zach will be Head Waiter and Dusty will be on staff. 
&nbsp;Andy, is, of course thrilled...less outing charges that he has to pay! &nbsp;I will 
fly up with the boys in June and spend a girls&#8217; week&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">on the bay. &nbsp;If I plan another 13 of these kinds of trips I 
will have, maybe, equaled Andy's number of boys' week-ends at ICFC.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We'll head up for our family stay on July 15th. &nbsp;Andy and I 
will drive to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>
for Cary Scott's wedding, then up to ICFC. &nbsp;We'll stay for 2 or 3 weeks. &nbsp;We're 
pretty certain that Maggie will join us during that time before she has to get 
ready for another&nbsp;school year. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our biggest news of the year is my new puppy! &nbsp;She's my 
constant companion. &nbsp;Her name is Izzi!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hoping to train her to be 
a therapy dog at a local Hospice. &nbsp;(we have a ways to go!) <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I've been working retail part-time this year which has 
provided me with many more hysterical stories. &nbsp;I'm crazy, but I love it. 
&nbsp;Andy's DQ is really picking up now that we finally have some warm weather. 
&nbsp;He's quite good at making hot-dogs and Orange Julius. &nbsp;He's not mastered the 
Blizzard yet. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dusty is finishing up his last year in middle school and, 
despite cutting off his left index finger, he did well academically and with 
basketball. (finger was successfully re-attached!) &nbsp;We hear from Zach every so 
often and he seems to have had a good year at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Arizona</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Maggie finished her Master's in Urban Education and had her hands full with 33 
3rd graders. &nbsp;It was great fun to volunteer with them. &nbsp;Can't wait to see 
everyone!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On a sad note, my ex sister-in law Betsy Brown died in

<p class="MsoNormal">As I sit here looking over the front bay, checking email, I 
am thinking of all the fun to come this summer.&nbsp; Colleen, the girls and I 
will be in for Memorial Day with friends on&nbsp;their first time visit to camp.&nbsp; 
Their daughter is a prospective waiter girl recruit for 2013 with Meg and Sammi.&nbsp; 
Then off to Brian Sloan's&nbsp;wedding early June.&nbsp; There is a slight chance I 
will&nbsp;be in camp prior to opening.&nbsp; We then plan to return for a week at the 
end of July.&nbsp; If we're lucky, we may return during&nbsp;last week of camp, but 
Colleen doesn't know about that yet.&nbsp; Finally if all goes well, there will 
be a September long&nbsp;weekend in my distant future.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Softball&nbsp; May and June will keep the girls and 
Colleen, she's&nbsp;the head coach, busy in between rains.&nbsp; And you never know 
where I'll show up on business. Perhaps I will call you if I'm in your town&nbsp;some 
night.&nbsp; If not I hope to see you all on the bay sometime.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>
for &#8220;the Nandy nuptials&#8221; [lots of tennis/golf/fun, etc.] and for Nicky and

she is WAY too tired for us to go out on Friday night &#8211; a double money bonus! 
She is still busy with a variety of charities, tennis leagues, and trying to 
keep track of Rebecca. She actually does watch one TV show [first one since &#8216;ER&#8217; 
about 18 years ago] &#8211; &#8216;Modern Family&#8217; - &nbsp;which we won&#8217;t say who, reminds us of

still lives at home, because after watching some educational television [90210, 
Gossip Girls, The Kartrashians, Family Guy, etc.] she usually hides the remote 
so I won&#8217;t cancel her recordings. She is doing great &#8211; lots of social

<p class="MsoNormal">All is well with the Steffey Family. We&#8217;ve had an exciting 
year, indeed!&nbsp; On October 24th, Katherine turned 40. It seems like just 
yesterday that she was born and blessed us with her generous spirit. Just days 
after Katherine&#8217;s birthday, on October 30th, Liz and Nate got married in the 
Berkshires on a beautiful, crisp Fall day.&nbsp; Following their nuptials they 
moved into a lovely, little apartment in Park Slope, <st1:place w:st="on">
Brooklyn</st1:place>. They are both continuing with their work in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

in Jamaica Plain and will be transitioning from teaching at a charter school to

nearby. Stewart is continuing to teach at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName

 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and Hilde has been 
busy as ever with Farm Aid. On May 17, they welcomed their first babe, Eliza 
Flora Steffey, into the world. Nick and I are overjoyed and in awe. We are 
trying to keep our cool as new grandparents and in-laws. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We can&#8217;t wait to get up to Treetops and plan to arrive 
sometime after August 1 and before August 10th. The rest of our gang will be 
coming up around the second and third weeks of August. We are looking forward to

for Christmas with the Abramsons - and Barbara and Dave Wright, Nikki&nbsp;and Oscar

w:st="on">Shari</st1:place>, Barbara and Carole visited for a week, and we were 
there on and off until the end of March - home in time to go to Pgh for the 
fabulous wedding of Nikki and Nate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the midst of all of this we acquired an adorable, 
charming but incorrigible Boykin spaniel puppy&nbsp;- named Robert after Daddy, but 
known as Bert.&nbsp; I think we might be too old for this, but we adore him and 
surely someday he will calm down.<o:p></o:p></p>

for knee replacements on 6/6 and 6/9.&nbsp; We are sad that we cannot get to IC

one of the few days without rain that month. Nate loves fishing and cooking 
fish. Over Labor Day he caught four fish with a combined weight of more than 11 
lbs.! Naturally, Nate caught those fish &quot;somewhere out in the Bay&quot; We were 
blessed to have so many of our Iron City family and friends at the wedding. 
Nikki and Nate are now living in Boston.&nbsp;Dave and Lisa and Katie have settled in 
Bethesda, MD and get to see their Abramson cousins every now and then. Katie is

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First of all, and with a little bit of sadness, I do not 
think we will be having a vegetable garden this summer. &nbsp;While I ideally 
continue to believe a garden could be productive, we need to have a greater 
commitment (perhaps hire a gardener) to make it worth the effort. &nbsp;I would be 
happy to re-visit this idea with other gardeners who share my enthusiasm.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The good news is that I will personally be sponsoring two 
new ICFC recycling efforts - a<u>thletic shoes and tennis balls.</u> &nbsp;Both are 
extensions of similar efforts in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>. &nbsp;Please donate all brands of athletic shoes. 
&nbsp;They must be dry and have no cleats. &nbsp;The more worn out, the better! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
being brought to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>, 
they will be shipped to Nike. &nbsp;Nike will grind and use them to make running 
tracks and playground mats. &nbsp;It takes 25,000 pair of shoes to make a full sized 
high school track. &nbsp;The tennis balls will also be brought back to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">
Pittsburgh</st1:place></st1:City>, and sent to a company that recharges them for 
use by tennis pros.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Donating shoes or tennis balls keeps them out of local 
landfills, and extends their usefulness. &nbsp;Boxes for both of these will be at 
ICFC this summer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The committee will also sponsor our second annual water 
level recording ceremony held over the weekend of the Fourth of July. &nbsp;Our 
official measuring board hangs near the main dock, and will be dipped and the 
water depth recorded for posterity. &nbsp;This effort has been spearheaded by Jack 
Huber.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
