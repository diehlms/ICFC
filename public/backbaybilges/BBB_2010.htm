<p class=MsoNormal>The Alexander cottage on top of Garbage Hill is going to
have a good bit of activity this summer.  Pete and Jane are planning to be in
camp the first week in June and again in early September.  Stewart and Donna
are planning on the second week of June. Dave and Laura are planning on the
third week of June. Dave and Cindy are planning on arriving on July Fourth for
several days and maybe again in August.  Lee and Mary Ellen are planning on mid
July until early August with Jenny and Tim, Andrea, Caroline and Landon
arriving the third week in July.  Joe and Kathy are planning on several days in

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cindy and Peter will be in camp around the first ten days in
July. &nbsp;When we get there will depend on their respective trips to Europe
and the Caribbean. &nbsp;Peter will go to Haiti with a group of Blair students
to the town of La Vallee, and Cindy will represent the Association of
Late-Deafened Adults, (ALDA, Inc) in Sweden, Finland and England at biennial and annual conventions.&nbsp; Lyn and Sofia are planning to spend the
first week in August at Iron City, before all of the Amermans return to PA for
Peter’s sister Lucy’s wedding on the 8th. &nbsp;We are trying to convince Lucy
and Jackson to come to ICFC with us. &nbsp;Who knows when Alex Amerman will
head north? We hope to find out... Love to all, C&amp;P</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Duncan &amp; Janet Anderson:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Duncan and Janet had a very busy “off-season” with work and
family. Our travels brought us to Napa and Sonoma for our 25<sup>th</sup>
anniversary, to Vegas, and to Tortola in the spring. We had great fun (and good
snow!) on our annual family ski trip to Waterville Valley over Christmas and
New Year’s with Kristen and Courtney. Kristen is loving living in New York City, and has seen the country with extensive travel on her job. Courtney had a
wonderful varsity tennis season, and is going into varsity badminton tournament
this week. She spent spring break in Portland, Oregon, at a Habitat for
Humanity Build week.&nbsp; In March she started training for her European
cycling trip this summer. During July she will ride from&nbsp;Amsterdam to Barcelona, crossing the Pyrenees and the Alps, averaging 75 miles per day on the bike! Our
family will be in camp for the tennis tournament, the meeting, and the
following week. Can’t wait!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nan and I have gotten engaged as of March 23rd!&nbsp; The
kids, Nan and I are all very excited!&nbsp; Also, Parker will be working at
ICFC this summer as a first year staff member.&nbsp; The rest of us will be in

<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'>The Dave Bennetts are back to
July this year, planning to spend the last 2 weeks in ICFC.&nbsp;They are
bringing Christine's&nbsp;14 year old niece, Madison Zimmerman, with
them.&nbsp; Madison has been to Iron City on three other occasions and
has&nbsp;her eye&nbsp;on wait staff position for next summer.&nbsp;Dave Sr. and
Charde will already be in camp, arriving sometime after the commotion of July
4th has calmed down.&nbsp; Christine is set to repeat her commuting schedule,
coming up in June with Cathy Collins and 3 of our staff leadership: Stewart,
Hallie and Megan -- to open the cottage and camp.&nbsp; She returns in July for
family vacation, then again in August to close and pick-up surviving
staff.&nbsp; Stewart is living in Pittsburgh, taking a full schedule of courses
at CCAC and working.&nbsp; John finishes his junior year at The College of
Wooster (OH) this May, studying Communications.&nbsp; And Hallie is in her
first year at Ithaca College beginning a program that leads to an advanced
degree in Physical Therapy.&nbsp; With Stewart and Hallie in Camp for the
summer, John gets the spare car -- woo-hoo!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Ricky &amp; Annie Bergland:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rickety Rick and I survived the long, snowy winter in Baltimore.&nbsp; The most important task after each new accumulation of snow was to shovel
a place for the dogs to get out.&nbsp; Most of our dogs are ten or older and
have very short legs. Needless to say there was a lot of yellow snow on the
back porch.&nbsp; Our 100 pound Newfy puppy, Olive, from Aubrey Phillips, was
thrilled with the mounting piles of snow and wanted to stay outside all
day.&nbsp; Of course, she was also wearing a luxurious black fur coat. Emily
and Eleanor have transitioned pretty well from cool college life to the cold,
cruel world. Eleanor stayed in Charlottesville and is working as a nurse in the
recovery room at UVA Hospital. She is surrounded by blood and guts (but gives
us grief about hair balls when she comes home) and loves the challenge and the
opportunity to continue to learn. She sees the Phillips often and has lots of&nbsp;ICFC
visitors. Emily is working in the press department at Sotheby's auction house
in NYC. She has the opportunity to see, hold, and wear some of the world's
finest art and jewels which makes her mother unspeakably jealous. Despite being
surrounded by riches she is living in a teeny, tiny (but neat) apartment with
an old high school friend.&nbsp; All those summers in the waiter cabins were
good practice.&nbsp; There are many ICFC&nbsp;folks in New York and they have&nbsp;gotten
together a few times.&nbsp; She has even seen her cousin, Austin Applegate, who
is dating a girl named Annie.&nbsp; Don't you think the world needs another
Annie Applegate? Brita is finishing her third year at Penn State. This winter she participated in Thon, the huge school wide fund raising marathon dance
event for the Penn State Children's Hospital. They raised over $7,000,000 this
year. Running IBM would be a walk in the park compared to all the coordination
that goes on for the event-astounding.&nbsp; You can see a video about it on YouTube.
Rick turned 60 in March. He celebrated by going to NYC to see <u>Jersey Boys</u>
which he LOVED (he sings a song from the musical to me every morning before
work-I am so lucky). We also had a romantic stay at a Bed and Breakfast outside
of Charlottesville-oh what a night!&nbsp; Anyhow, we all hope to get to camp
this summer. I will be there in time for the meeting to take copious notes (although
I haven't quite figured out just how I am going to get there).&nbsp; Brita
might come with me or go with her dad the first weekend of August. El and Em
are coping with the reality of the working world with only two weeks vacation.
They hope to be in camp the second week of August when most of their buddies
will be there.&nbsp; It is very frustrating to have to use&nbsp;two precious
days&nbsp;for coming and going.&nbsp; C'est la vie. By the way, Manly and his
eldest son, Amos, will be in camp the week of Memorial Day putting in a new
kitchen in Rocky Roost. He has ordered all the supplies&nbsp;from Home Depot in
Parry Sound and feels certain he will get it all finished in a week. He remains
Cool.&nbsp; The rest of us pale in comparison. Cathie will be in South
Carolina-clever girl. I am hoping the next renovation will be the bunk room.
The allure of sleeping in the basement with worms and beer and batteries is
starting to wear off. We will have to save the ceiling somehow; it is
historical.&nbsp; The oldest signature is 1963. I will never be mature enough
to sleep in mother and dad's room, although it has a great view. Whew, Happy
Canada to one and all.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Bill &amp; Jody Boak:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#444444'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bill Boaks are planning to be in camp from July 24th on
for two weeks with Scott and Kate and Loren and Charles Musgrove there for most
of that time too.&nbsp; Todd, Beth Courtney and Elsah won't be in camp this
summer as the girls have many activities and they are all going to Hawaii for Christmas!!!&nbsp; We will miss them - it's fun to get all of the cousins
together.&nbsp; Bill and I have been lucky to have had two trips to Florida this winter and spring and we played golf at Arnie Palmer's course, Bay Hill, which
was really fun.&nbsp; This past October all of our children (the adults) and
Loren and Charles's two little ones traveled to Bethlehem, Pa, to celebrate my
Dad's 90th birthday.&nbsp; It was a good trip!&nbsp; I know that my Dad
appreciated it!&nbsp; Scott and Kate with Ned and Loring will visit us in Chicago over Memorial Day week-end which also happens to be Courtney Boak's confirmation
and graduation from middle school as well as Beth Boak's birthday.&nbsp; Lots
of celebrating!&nbsp; We are anxious to see everyone in camp!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Dick &amp; Sue Boak:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Emily Boak will be on staff this summer as a waiter
person and lifeguard, Susan and Grace will be taking her up to ICFC for
orientation at the beginning of camp. Sue is working full time at Lehigh University, so Grace will stay in camp with John Boak and son Adam until July 4th
when Dick and Sue will return for about 10 days in early July. We’ll have to
come back toward the end of camp to pick up Emily, so many trips back and
forth! We’re looking forward to relaxing on the bay, but this year we’ll have
to relegate the peak season to Bill and Jody, and John and Helen. Rah, Rah,
Ray!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From John &amp; Helen Boak:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#444444'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John and Adam start the summer with no delay, arriving for
their 1st trip June 19. Then again with Helen for their family trip in August.
We are excited to have Helen's nephew Max Alles on the ICFC wait staff this
year...his first visit to camp! &nbsp;Welcome Max!&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can't wait to bring up our newest Boak (boat) family
addition–a 1988 Boston Whaler which John has been babying all winter! It sure
has been a&nbsp;long and tough winter, so we are all ready for the journey
north to return to our family on the beautiful Georgian&nbsp;Bay!&nbsp;&nbsp;Rah
Rah Ray!&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Scott &amp; Kate Boak:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Maine Boaks should be in Iron City at the end of July
and early&nbsp;August.&nbsp; Loring (age 4) and Ned (1.5) are looking forward
to seeing cousins, friends, frogs and fish.&nbsp; Loring is very into fairies, fancy&nbsp;dress-up
and reading, while Ned likes to explore, stumble around and screech.&nbsp; They
will be looking for playmates this summer (and their&nbsp;parents may be
looking for babysitters).&nbsp; Scott and Kate are excited&nbsp;to see other
Boaks, Crawfords, Gallehers and friends in camp.&nbsp; Kate&nbsp;got Scott a
new L.L.Bean bag for his birthday that says &quot;ICFC&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;rah
rah ray&quot; on it.&nbsp; Scott is expected to show it off proudly.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Bob and Barbara Boucek:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Bob and I are arriving on June
23rd, two days before Camp opens.&nbsp; Eric is going up then and has offered
to pick us up in Toronto.&nbsp; Bob will stay for 10 days and I will stay a
little longer.&nbsp; I think I am leaving on the 12th, sharing a taxi with
Jerry.&nbsp; I don't have specific dates yet for our second visit, but I will come
back when Braden and Monica and the babies do.&nbsp; They think it will be in
the middle of the last week of July.&nbsp; They will stay through the annual
meeting, the whole first week of August, so I will be there also.&nbsp; I don't
want to miss a day with the grandkids!&nbsp; Bob thinks that he will come back
for the last week of Camp, so I will stay through what ever dates he is
there.&nbsp; Bob is pondering the idea of retiring some time soon but as of
right now, he is still working at the University and that impacts his vacation
days.&nbsp; Jenny will not be coming&nbsp;to Camp&nbsp;this summer because she
is back working in the WNBA and the summer is the middle of the playing season
for her.&nbsp; She is back in Seattle working for the Storm and we are thrilled
to have her back in town.&nbsp; Her title is Director of Player Development and
Head of Scouting.&nbsp; Braden is still working as a Federal Prosecutor in Memphis.&nbsp; He&nbsp;and Monica were blessed by the birth of a beautiful baby girl
(Gracie Belle) in December.&nbsp; Shepherd is now 2 years old.&nbsp; Heath is
again looking for employment.&nbsp; He was a salesman for a medical device
company but they decided to cut&nbsp;their number of territories and
unfortunately, his area was one that was eliminated.&nbsp; My Mom,&nbsp;Eleanor
Heath, is now 92 years old!&nbsp; She is still living in Tampa but we have
moved her into a facility that specializes in Memory Impairment.&nbsp; We are
pleased with the care that she is getting, but she is slipping further into her
private world.&nbsp; We are blessed by the fact that she still recognizes all
of her children and when we visit, she knows&nbsp;who we are, and pours out her
love to us.&nbsp; Her sweet smile is still there every time she looks at one of
us. She is an amazing woman. </span>I guess that is about all of the Boucek
news.&nbsp; I don't know if any of that is of interest, but now you have
it.&nbsp; We are really looking forward to getting up to Camp and seeing all of
our friends and enjoying the beautiful Georgian Bay and all it offers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Ted &amp; Darcy Branch:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Branch family will be up for Memorial Day weekend if not
sooner.&nbsp; We finally got a new boat and are anxious for its maiden
voyage.&nbsp; Riley will be working at ICFC until at least July 18<sup>th</sup>
and possibly again in August.&nbsp; Kelsey will be at camp in NY all summer so
she is a no show during the season.&nbsp; Peggy Branch will be up at the start
of camp to kick off<span style='color:red'> </span>the kayaking season.&nbsp;
Ted &amp; Darcy will be up from July 1<sup>st</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> and then
again as Riley’s work schedule requires.&nbsp; We will be in camp the week of
August 23<sup>rd</sup> too.&nbsp; Ted is planning a trip to the Outer Banks
with Jay Douglass<span style='color:red'> </span>in early May for a mid-life
crisis prevention clinic featuring kite boarding therapy.&nbsp; Look for more
kites over the front bay this summer. That’s it from me.&nbsp; Perhaps Darcy
can add something.&nbsp; As for the Scotts, I believe Monty, Brian and Jenny will
be up Memorial Day weekend.&nbsp; These three are also planning a trip to South Africa in July or August so we may not see much of them during the season.</p>

	<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Todd &amp; Kathy Chapple:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big news is a double graduation on the Dallas Chapple side.&nbsp;
Following his stage debut in the musical “Good News” and Shakespeare’ A
Midsummer Night’s Dream”, Bennett V is graduating from Highland Park High
School and heading for Hendrix College in Conway Arkansas.&nbsp; Caitlin is
graduating from the University of Colorado with a major in Environmental Policy
and a minor in Economics.&nbsp; Like all high achievers Bennett V is
celebrating with a trip to Disney World.&nbsp; Wrangler Caitlin is heading up
to Estes Park to wrangle some horses and sing John Denver tunes with the
greenhorns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The big news for Ben &amp; Sharon aka team “We’re
Not Dead Yet” is their 260ish place finish at the World Series of Beer Pong V
championship in Las Vegas in January.&nbsp; The Dallas Chapples anticipate
being on the bay the second week of August.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Denver Chapples (aka the Younger Ones) have also enjoyed
a busy year.&nbsp; Henry (14) has been playing competitive soccer and running
cross country for his school.&nbsp; Hannah (12) has been in several festivals
with the Young Voices of Colorado choir and recently finished her role as
Flatware (a spoon) and a Wolf in a production of Beauty &amp; the Beast.&nbsp;
William (10) aka “The Wall” has continued to dominate in the central defense
for his Option One Soccer team.&nbsp; Will’s motto is “either the Ball or the
Boy can go by, never both.” &nbsp; Oliver (7 today) is also playing soccer,
but, more importantly, Oliver is simply enjoying his life and his new
trampoline. &nbsp;As a group, we got in our 20+ days of Colorado skiing with
Kathy and me enjoying a four day ski trip to Taos, NM with our ICFC friends, Dr.
Leon &amp; Philosopher Erin Irish.&nbsp; &nbsp;Borrowing the “We’re Not Dead
Yet” team moniker Leon and Todd competed and completed the Helly Hansen<span
style='color:red'> </span>Big Mountain Challenge. We are planning to be in camp
the last two weeks of July.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the Pittsburgh Chapples (aka P&amp;B) – Great News – the
current plan is for a mid-to-late July trip to ICFC! &nbsp;They will also be
attending Caitlin’s graduation from CU next weekend.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#444444'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, for those who haven’t heard – the brand spanking new
4 stroke – 20 HP – outboard engine that in late July was inadvertently jettisoned
to the bottom of Georgian Bay near Henry’s Seafood in 60 feet of water – was
recovered by deep sea diver Moe in September, transported to Chris &amp; Master
Mechanic Gary at Moon River Marina where it was successfully drained, cleaned,
and brought back to life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thank the gods.&nbsp; Dad if you
are reading this - give me a call, I’ve got a heck of a story to tell you.</p>

July. Looking forward to great fishing, tennis, and hanging out with friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest news in our family is Shannon’s marriage to Rudy
Borrego and the birth of our third grandchild Mira. That may trump Crawford’s
team winning the gold medal in his Mississauga hockey division and / or Haven’s
‘Cirque Du Soleil’ gymnastic stunts.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chip was in camp for a work week in early May. Michel &amp;
Chip will be in camp in late June, prior to camp opening while Chip assists the
HR Committee with leadership and team development for the 2010 Fab 5.  We
return with Shannon and Mira (7+ months in July) the last week of July. You
will see the Strickers in camp to overlap with us during certain weekends.
Crawford is now 9 and Haven is 5.  We hope to have a long stretch after camp
from late August through the 3<sup>rd</sup> week in September.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

years) who lives in his apt building and they share activities and have fun. He
continues to play bridge and socialize a lot. Kerry, Liza and Bill, Todd &amp;
Tracy and their new adorable son Potter Edgerton, came down from Virginia for the event! Hill Todd and Kirkland Todd joined in the fun, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Daughter Lauren Edgerton is living
in Beverly Hills and attending UCLA's Anderson School's program for graduate
masters degree in financial engineering ( MFE). Among other course, she is
taking &quot;derivatives' and so this will make her possibly the only person in
  America who understands those complex investments! Ford and his significant
other Amy are still an item and living in Santa Monica. He is still at Aetna. I </span>went <span style='color:black'>out to visit recently and we had a fabulous
day hike out at Point Dume, just north of Malibu. I recommend it! As for me, I
am playing tennis like crazy, in preparation for the big ICFC tennis tournament
this summer!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Kerry had a great time visiting
Jim Kinnear at Cedar Grove in VA. He reports that Jim is an outstanding host
and croquet player! Now what ever happened to ICFC croquet...I seem to recall a
croquet course....and then a putting green...! Maybe we should find a spot to
resurrect croquet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I currently plan to&nbsp;be
there&nbsp;three times: (a) May 27-June 2, 2010; (b) June 28- July 5; (c) July
29 -August 15 and maybe longer. I will be writing the great American novel
during my stay. I am hoping Laurie will be with me (and maybe Eric for some of
May trip but it is uncertain). Eric will be cooking the great American gourmet
camp meal during his stay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;Kerry will definitely join
me for trip (c), e.g. July 29-August 15. He will probably also come up over
July 4th, with some encouragement. He was originally to come Memorial Day to
help me get Twin Pines open after this most recent round of Alex </span>Crookshank’s
<span style='color:black'>fabulous work, but other fabulous social events
intervened. Kerry will be splitting his time at ICFC between the serving as his
little sister's fishing guide&nbsp;for the great Georgian Bay bass, significant
porching, sunrise male bonding swims, and trying to ingratiate himself
sufficiently with me so he can join on the George G's great fishing outing that
I&nbsp;purchased last summer in the auction. Kerry is mad with desire to join
that event!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ford and Amy will likely join me
for one 10 day period between July 29-August 15. Probably the second week of
August. They will likely devote themselves to socializing with their age group,
but Ford will be dragged into playing tennis with his mother, as she has
recently identified a new career -- that of tennis bum. Lauren is a
possibility, but it depends on whether she gets an internship this summer and
what the dates are for said internship. Lauren's interests at ICFC are
tentative -- I am thinking also about her for my tennis career, as she was on
her high school tennis teams and so can get the ball back and forth no matter
what.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Liza said she would try and come
-- I think the July 4th weekend is probably her only chance, as she and Bill
spend 3 weeks in Lake Placid for end of July and first 2 weeks of August. Liza
will add grace and good looks to Twin Pines so I really hope she comes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>At one point, it looked like
Laurie, Eric and Elsie were scheduled in for Aug 7 - Aug 15; I do not know if
those plans are firm. All is better when they are about. Much better.</span></p>

believe that will all change as summer gets closer and they hear the call of
the loon. Charlie is one I always count on for the first two weeks of
August&nbsp; but I have no info on this--- anyway, it is his fault ( as well as
Chas' fault) that I am playing tennis so madly. I bought an auction lesson with
them last summer and had so much fun in my lesson that I took the game up again
and now play on three tennis leagues in Nashville. (This does not mean I WIN
much yet, so stay calm.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recently Grace was encouraged by her April Fools’ Day loving
mother to bake brownies for her 6<sup>th</sup> grade homeroom class.&nbsp;
Naturally, Grace and her mother added just a dash of hot sauce to one of the
brownies.&nbsp; Shortly after dropping off a giddy and far too trusting Gracie
at school, Heather called her favorite teacher to see if he would storm around
the classroom pretending to be outraged at the gag.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen has many friends who seem to live vicariously off of
his ICFC experiences.&nbsp; Through such tools as text messaging, facebook
photos, and YouTube videos, these Houston friends have become familiar with
both the camp and many of Stephen’s ICFC friends.&nbsp; They seem to feel that
they are, or should be, members of the extended ICFC family.&nbsp; Stephen
posted a number of photos from his time on staff last summer on his facebook
page.&nbsp; Not long after, some of his Houston friends quietly enhanced the
photos digitally adding themselves into several group shots.&nbsp; A friend or
two endeavored to pass themselves off in text messages as a staff member who
had somehow not been noticed by the actual staff.&nbsp; When Stephen returned
to town, he placed an ICFC bumper sticker on his car.&nbsp; One clever friend
made surreptitious copies of the bumper sticker, and we now see “ICFC” proudly
displayed on strange cars all over town.</p>

contributor for the camper team at the ICFC Sunday softball games.&nbsp; Lilly
is also looking forward to horseback riding camp this summer, as well as art
classes.&nbsp; She is a creative and artistic girl who loves to draw, paint,
and create.&nbsp; We hope that she will follow in the footsteps of so many of
ICFC’s outstanding artists. Kate (age 5) is completing her last year at pre-k
and will enter kindergarten next fall.&nbsp; She is growing up fast, as
exemplified by her desire to give up her training wheels.&nbsp; Kate also
enjoys horseback riding and gymnastics, but she’s yet undecided about other
activities this summer.&nbsp; However, both girls are committed
fisher-women.&nbsp; Lilly and Kate have plans to take back the Kinnear Cup this
summer in their effort to establish a Jenkins girls dynasty during the coming
decade (<i>à la</i> Fritz boys in the ‘80s). Our big family news of note was
the adoption of a boy.&nbsp; Indie came into our lives on November 15, 2009

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It has been a busy winter for
me.&nbsp; In the Fall, I was appointed as Executive Director of The Counseling
Foundation of Canada, a grant making foundation started by my grandfather in
1959 (I had been serving in an interim&nbsp;capacity already&nbsp;for a
year).&nbsp; The Foundation provides seed grant money to organizations that
provide innovative approaches to delivering career counseling and which lead
people to employability and higher education, an especially laudable mission in
light of the current economic climate.&nbsp; Over the last few months, I've
visited a number of communities across Canada to meet with&nbsp;many of the
organizations we're funding - am always astounded by work people are doing, and
the beauty of Canada from coast to coast.&nbsp; In addition to the Foundation,
I am serving as the&nbsp;Board Chair of Casey House - year 1 of a two year
role.&nbsp; When it was founded in 1988, Casey House was the first freestanding
hospice providing care exclusively to people dying of AIDS.&nbsp; With the
advent of antiretroviral therapies, most of our work is now in helping people
manage their disease and rehabilitating them after hospitalization for acute
illness.&nbsp; This ends up being about a day a week of my time, on top of
work.&nbsp; We're in the planning&nbsp;to build a new hospice which will
dramatically expand our reach,&nbsp;help people better manage their disease and
stay out of hospital.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>No big travel plans at the

they didn't get enough riders to go forward for 2010.&nbsp; They're hoping to
get more interest for 2011, so if anyone is interested in&nbsp;partaking and
seeing another part of the Bay, please let me know! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Will be up at camp a number of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>All-in-all, a good year for all of
us. &nbsp;Zach had a fabulous time volunteering in Cape Town South Africa but I'll let him tell you all about it. &nbsp;He started at the University of Arizona in January. &nbsp;A wet, cold desert winter that finally turned into
Spring has convinced him to go back next fall. &nbsp;Maggie has been incredibly
busy teaching 2nd and 3rd grade at a Title I school in Denver while working on
her Masters. &nbsp;We've loved having her at home with us but, now, she is
officially hired and on her own starting in August so I don't think it will be
too long that she'll want a place of her own. &nbsp;She keeps us laughing with
all of the funny things that her kids say. &nbsp;Dusty keeps us going with
basketball games and tennis practices, friends and school! &nbsp;(Thank
goodness he doesn't need help with his math)! &nbsp;Andy's &quot;crushed&quot;

&nbsp;MA is good, had a very fun job for awhile, now looking again and also
getting busy on the tennis courts. &nbsp; We'll probably be in ICFC the last 2

<p class=MsoNormal>Since February 27, the day of the 8.8 double epicenter
earthquake in Chile, we have been pretty pre-occupied with our home and friends
in the south. Thankfully, Castillo Verde emerged with only a few cracks of no
consequence, a broken pot (poor Scott Barnim) and the greatest tragedy- a
crystal decanter of David's favorite single malt toppled on the granite
counter. Friends were not so lucky with many historic and wonderful fundos,
historic churches&nbsp;and village&nbsp;streets full of modest adobe homes in
&quot;en suelo&quot; (in the ground).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were in Canada during the big one but returned on several
occasions since then, where we got quite used to the replicas or aftershocks.
Nothing under a 5.8 is worth noticing for either of us at this stage. We have
been taking aid with us on each trip and thanks to the kindness of Air Canada; this reached a total of over 2100 pounds of clothing and warm bedding.  We plan to
visit Iron City starting in June (to escape the G20 Summit meeting which is
being held in our neighborhood). I will probably head up to ICFC late in June-
David will be on a cross continental motorcycle trip from LA to Toronto at that time. He spent 3 months touring Chile from north to south&nbsp;so this

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We are all well and busy as
beavers in our various endeavors. Nancy and Tim Scott's son Casey graduates from
High School this June and that with a number of important family birthdays
coming up keeps us planning. Bruce has just flown himself up to Vermont from his job in Florida and hopes&nbsp;to spend most of the summer there, with
perhaps a few short trips over to ICFC and also back to Fla. when needed. Liz
and Cliff have moved over to Maine to see how they like living here. They have
been spending so much time here because of family that they are tired of
tripping. At the moment they are in our guest cottage next door which makes it
very nice for me. I think they think I am getting older and will need some more
care before long but, of course, I feel young and energetic and see no such
need, for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>It does not look as though any of
us will be spending any extended time at Iron City this year as Casey and Sarah
are both working and so is everybody else!&nbsp; I hope to come over with Bruce
on some occasions. Because of our plans being so uncertain I want to make the
cottage available to those who may need it over the encampment season. Please
call or email me (both are in the ICFC book) if any one is interested. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>I have just returned from Florida and am enjoying an early Spring here in Maine and am busy with a cottage renovation
for my step-children and other family members. I think of our Iron City family so very fondly and wish you all a great encampment this summer.</span></p>

graduations this spring/summer.&nbsp; Tucker finishes his masters program at Georgetown in the School of Foreign Service in 2 weeks. Carly Reed also graduates from
G-town the same weekend, so we will be seeing Richard and Cary, plus Tim and
Susie Williams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Devon graduates from the University of Washington&nbsp;in June with a bachelor's degree in Speech and Hearing
Science.&nbsp; We are all hoping to be in camp during the second week in
August, and hopefully will&nbsp;enlist campers to join us in another Debbie
Sawin Swim from Pike's Peak.&nbsp; Hope to see you there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We plan our ICFC visits for late
June, August and September this year.&nbsp; Everyone will try to be there in
August, Allie and family for sure, Carrie for sure and Dave and Will depending
on the job requirements.&nbsp; Dave is at Polo in New York, Will at Vail Corp.
in CO, so at this point we are glad for pay checks!&nbsp; We joined a great
ICFC group in the fall for&nbsp;a look at the Dalmatian coast with stops in Croatia and nearby countries.&nbsp; Eric Williams did great research to lay out an
interesting week.&nbsp; Friday lunch during the work week in Pittsburgh usually
calls for an ICFC gathering in the Fox Chapel area, so the warm weather is
bringing talk of camp.&nbsp; See you there!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><em><span style='font-style:normal'>I was in Pittsburgh digging out all winter with the exception of two quick trips to Toronto for SSCA Board meetings. As a reward for surviving the winter without a warm
weather getaway, I am off to the &quot;Beautiful Blue Danube&quot; for a few weeks
with an extension trip&nbsp;to Prague. The trip includes such countries as; Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria and the Czech Republic. I have
previously been to Austria and Croatia.&nbsp;If I add&nbsp;six&nbsp;new
countries every year for the next ten years and Alex quit traveling today I
might be able to surpass the number of countries he has been to. Not going to
happen! </span></em>I plan on being at Iron City for Memorial Day, Camp Opening, Fourth of July, Mary S. Scott Memorial etc. I&nbsp;hope to be on a trip to
the Nile with the IC Elders Travel Group in October.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The whole family&nbsp;enjoyed skiing this winter with our
record snow in Pittsburgh. We plan to be in camp in June for a short
trip&nbsp;before camp opens. Then, visiting again in late July for a week. We
hope to see a lot of our friends at that time.&nbsp; Samantha and Heather can't

<p class=MsoNormal>Rob: June 18 - June 27; August&nbsp;3 - August&nbsp;13;
August 20 - 22.&nbsp; I know Katie Scott will be joining me during peak week
time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren, Joanie&nbsp;&amp; Coco&nbsp;have vacation time issues
but I hope they can come up&nbsp;for at least 4 days.&nbsp; Rik and Lindsay
will be up on June&nbsp;19 when they bring Alexis to serve as a Headwaiter for
the summer and they will likely stay for at least a few days.&nbsp; After this
past winter, we're especially&nbsp;looking forward to&nbsp;spending time on the
Bay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Bobby and Judy Sillers:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judy &amp; Bobby Sillers’ family is looking forward to
another great summer on the Georgian Bay! Scott has been busy earning his EMT
[Emergency Medical Technician] license and trying to wear out Elsie, his new
Australian Shepherd puppy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rebecca is about to finish her first year in high school,
has finished her Driver’s Ed course [yipes!], was a member of the high school
cross country team, and is looking forward to being a first-year waiter at ICFC
this summer. Judy is being Judy – she is training people in her personal
training business 12-15 hours per week [love that 5 AM  alarm clock…], playing
in a very competitive tennis league, all the while co-chairing a very large
charity event that is a full year in the planning. And trying to raise Rebecca
and Bobby… Bobby?  Work, tennis, carpooling teenagers. And plotting a re-taking
of the shuffleboard championship with Rick Bergland  - the Ricky-Bobby team
WILL triumph again! Judy and I play a fair amount of bridge with Ginny and Don.
It will be tough not having them with us in ICFC. We are taking a family cruise
in late May, and are looking forward to lots of bocce, tennis, shuffleboard,
charades and egg days when we arrive in late July.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Wally &amp; Tallie Sloan:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=ecxmsonormal style='background:white'>Hi to all, Wally and Tallie just
returned May 7<sup>th</sup> from their first trip to ICFC. We had Buster, our
yellow lab, and the newest member of the family, Holly, a 6 month old German
Short Haired Pointer to keep us company. Holly was a surprise Christmas gift
from our wonderful children! Chip beat us to camp so we weren’t the first this
year! We enjoyed his company too. We had cold, windy, rainy weather with some
snow mixed in on Sunday. The board walks are certainly slippery when frozen! At
least we were able to get the garden weeded and mulched before black fly
season! Camp looks great already. The work crew has been busy raking and
cleaning up from the winter and there are many projects going on all over the
place! Our kids are all well and working hard. Marge and Jack McCarthy moved
this year to a wonderful new condo in Punta Gorda. It is just beautiful! Mom
had a hip replacement this year and is doing very well. Dad is recovering from
an emergency appendectomy a few weeks ago. He is bouncing back well but that
was a complete surprise! To IC April 30th &amp; May 27th weekends /  Jun 17-21
/ July 2-7 / Aug 4-16 / Aug 27 - Oct 15. We are looking forward to seeing
everyone in camp!&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Nick &amp; Beth Steffey:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Steffey clan is in the midst of an exciting year!! Biz
and her fiancé Nate&nbsp;are very excited for their&nbsp;October
wedding&nbsp;in the Berkshires. They have great memories of the NYC-ICFC steak
picnic they hosted at their apartment in Brooklyn this winter. Biz is finishing
up her&nbsp;Master’s degree&nbsp;at&nbsp;Columbia&nbsp;and has landed a job
working for&nbsp;a&nbsp;foreign policy think tank in NYC, specializing in&nbsp;Asia
Pacific Security. Nate continues to write for the Daily News and has hopes to
write a second book in the making that seeks to explain what it takes to be a
downhill ski racer. They are excited to escape to ICFC in early
August.&nbsp;Much to the family’s content, Tyler has returned to&nbsp;Boston&nbsp;permanently after much worldly travel and work.&nbsp; He is working hard to
create the high-school Spanish program at one of the older charter schools in Boston – Boston Collegiate Charter School. Tyler spent his February and April break
in&nbsp;Haiti&nbsp;working with a small NGO that focuses on getting children
back in school since the earthquake.&nbsp; He will unfortunately only be in
ICFC for the second week of August, as he landed a job this summer leading a
summer program for inner-city youth.&nbsp; Nick’s insurance venture in&nbsp;Rhode Island continues to grow impressively, but he always takes time away to remind Frank
Coyle that it’s only April and the&nbsp;Red Sox&nbsp;are ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beth is
doing wonderfully. She has&nbsp;been traveling to the Berkshires quite a bit
lately for wedding planning and to visit&nbsp;Katherine&nbsp;who&nbsp;is
enjoying her new home, Russet House.&nbsp; Katherine will be on the bay in late
July and would love to see as many friends as possible.&nbsp; Hardly a
conversation goes by without some mention of her favorite Bonidy<span
style='color:red'> </span>kids.&nbsp; Stew, Hilde and pet Trot are loving Arlington, looking forward to two weeks in ICFC towards the end of July and beginning of
August.&nbsp; Sorry to be long winded but the bilge needs to be filled!!
Happy&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;to everyone. I guess I’ll congratulate the Canadian
Olympic Team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From Charlie &amp; Franny Stewart:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As per usual, the Stewarts are scattered hither and yon.
Franny is returning from a month-long trip in China, where she set up her new
office in Shanghai. Natalie graduates from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, and is seeking employment in the video documentary world. If you
know of anyone who can offer some helpful advice, please pass it on. Julia is
finishing her junior year at Lewis and Clark in International Affairs and is
hoping to get an internship in the print media world this summer. (Ditto the
plea for advice.) And, by the time you read this, Chas will be somewhere in the
middle of Virginia on the Appalachian Trail heading north to Maine, where he
hopes to reach Mt. Katahdin by mid-August, prior to beginning his freshman year
at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. As for Charlie, he is
writing occasionally for local publications (see <a
href="http://www.post-gazette.com/" target="_blank">www.post-gazette.com</a>
and search Charlie Stewart), taking out the garbage weekly, paying bills
monthly, playing golf, gardening, acting as ground support for Chas by sending
him his meals in weekly food drops, and getting his tennis game in order so
that he is ready to give Lynne Edgerton and Campbell and Jamie Huber more
tennis lessons. Hope to see you in August!!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We Stronachs are very excited about Spyglass, and from all
reports it sounds like the work on it is going well.&nbsp; We plan to get to IC
sometime in June to check things out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>George continues to recover from his back surgery of last
summer - he hasn't been able to fish yet but will surely be ready for
IC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly we had to move Mother to an Alzheimer’s unit in Tampa last summer.&nbsp; They take beautiful care of her and she is not unhappy.&nbsp; Shari and I were with her for a few days last week, and Barbara and Carole not long before
that.&nbsp; Rob is able to check in frequently.&nbsp; Her address is: 334 Avon Pl., Brighton Gardens,&nbsp;and 16702 N. Dale Mabry Hwy., Tampa FL 33618. The Creightons have just moved into a beautiful house on the Albemarle Sound in
Edenton.&nbsp; Marshall will&nbsp;arrive in camp with Eleanor, Porter and
Charles on 7/26.&nbsp; Unfortunately Scott and Britt cannot make it this summer.&nbsp;
The Abramsons and George IV Stronachs will arrive about&nbsp;7/23 for about 10
days and we plan to be there the last week in July&nbsp;and 1st week in
August.&nbsp; Both the Heath cabin and Spyglass will be full!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shari King will be driving to camp with Lainey Anderson

<p class=MsoNormal>Eric Williams, Gregg Scott, Tim &amp; Susie Williams, Chip
&amp; Michel Crawford, Alex &amp; Cris Scott, Cynnie Anderson &amp; Jerry
Rampelberg, and Cindy &amp; Peter Amerman joined together to take a cruise to 6
countries along the Adriatic Sea in late September.&nbsp; We started in Venice and visited Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, &amp; Bosnia/Herzegovina over a
10 day period.&nbsp; The highlight of the trip was in Venice while Cindy and
Peter were taking a romantic Gondola trip along the canals.&nbsp; The rest of
us sat at a table at an outside bar along the Grande Canale.&nbsp; When Peter
&amp; Cindy passed by, the ten of us gave a rousing Rah! Rah! Ray! to the
romantic couple as they floated by.&nbsp; As it was dark, the echo effect off
the buildings reverberated across the canal causing many tourists and natives
to wonder what was going on.&nbsp; It was a wonderful evening and a great trip.
Eric Williams is planning to arrive in camp on June 23rd and depart on July 5th
on his first visit this summer.&nbsp; Plans are in the air for the 2nd visit,
but Eric will be in camp for the semi-annual meeting in August.</p>

We lost&nbsp;Dottie on November 13th, and then gained Teddy in December and
Liam&nbsp;in February.&nbsp; We now have a basketball team of grandsons. Kira
and Dieter are enjoying a year in Darmstadt, Germany.&nbsp; They plan&nbsp;to
return to Massachusetts in August, but unfortunately will probably&nbsp;not get
to ICFC this summer.&nbsp; Lindsay and Matt with Teddy, Darcy and&nbsp;Jay with
Cole and Liam, and Tim and Susie will be in camp in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are
all excited to inspect all the wonderful work Moe has completed&nbsp;on our
cabin and to see all of our ICFC friends. Tim and Susie plan to be in camp for
Memorial Day, and weather&nbsp;permitting, Susie will plant the second annual
vegetable garden.&nbsp; If&nbsp; you will be at ICFC over Memorial Day, your
help planting will be&nbsp;needed and welcome.  See you all on the Bay.</p>

</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#003300'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On page 15 of the 2010 Yearbook, it states “The Canadian
recreational boating safety regulations now require proof of boat operator
competency for all operators of motor boats. U.S. state-issued operator cards
are considered as proof of competency. The Canadian Coast Guard Pleasure Craft
Operator card may be acquired online at <u>
<a href="http://www.theoperatorcard.ca">www.theoperatorcard.ca</a></u>. The
regulations include age and horsepower restrictions: if not accompanied and
directly supervised by a person of 16 or older, the operator under 12 years old
is restricted to a motor of maximum power of 10 hp; the operator over 12 but
under 16 years old is restricted to one of a maximum of 40 hp. The regulations also include minimum safety equipment
standards for all boats; these are strictly enforced by the Coast Guard who
regularly patrol Georgian Bay. Full details are available in the office.”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is some confusion about who needs an Ontario Boat Operators
License. It depends on whether your boat is registered in the US or Canada as well as the length of time (consecutive days) you spend in Canada. Most ICFC members completed the examination and now have valid operator’s licenses. Families
are encouraged to have all children complete the examination as the process
teaches safe boat operating practices.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This process can be difficult.&nbsp; First, you must find a
person 19 or older to be a Supervisor.&nbsp; This person CANNOT be a
relative.&nbsp; That person must register through the above website with the
Government.&nbsp; Once approved, they are sent the test materials. You arrange
a time, date, and place other than your home to take the exam.&nbsp; The
Supervisor submits the results and 24 hours later, you can print out your
temporary license.&nbsp; A permanent one will come in two weeks by mail. You
must answer 70% of the questions correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternative #3:&nbsp; Residents of Alabama, Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington can obtain a license from their home states
that will be accepted in Ontario.&nbsp; Check your State website for details</p>
